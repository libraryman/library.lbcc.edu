                        <h3>Eligibility</h3>


                        <ul>
                            <li>Interlibrary Loan is available to all Long
                            Beach City College regular and extension faculty,
                            staff, and students with a Long Beach City College
                            identification card, current validation sticker,
                            and a clear library record..</li>


                            <li>Interlibrary Loan service is not extended to
                            guest card holders, Research Affiliates, Friends of
                            the Library, Long Beach City College Alumni, and
                            mutual-use cardholders.</li>
                        </ul>


                        <h3>Interlibrary Loan Request Accepted</h3>


                        <ul>
                            <li>Interlibrary loan requests are accepted
                            in-person at the Circulation Desk and Reference
                            Desk</li>


                            <li>Requests are accepted for research purposes for
                            items not held by Long Beach City College
                            Library.</li>


                            <li><strong>Requests are NOT accepted for
                            recreational reading, currently required classroom
                            textbooks, and items held by the Long Beach City
                            College Library</strong>.</li>


                            <li>Long Beach City College non-circulating library
                            materials or items held on microform are considered
                            available for use and may not be requested through
                            Interlibrary Loan.</li>


                            <li>Long Beach City College library materials not
                            located on the shelf must be searched by the
                            Circulation staff and declared missing before the
                            interlibrary loan request is accepted.</li>


                            <li>Requests for Long Beach City College library
                            materials that are charged out are not accepted by
                            the Interlibrary Loan. The patron is asked to place
                            a "Hold" or "Recall" for the materials at the
                            Circulation Desk.</li>


                            <li>Requests are limited to 5 requests per person
                            per week for students and 7 requests per week for
                            faculty. The purpose of this limit is to make the
                            interlibrary loan service available to many rather
                            than to only a few.</li>


                            <li>Repeat requests for the same item by the same
                            person are not accepted due to the high cost of
                            interlibrary loan transactions. Items requested
                            often are brought to the attention of Collection
                            Development for possible purchase.</li>
                        </ul>


                        <h3>Fees to Borrowers</h3>


                        <p>In support of the academic programs and research at
                        Long Beach City College, the College Library normally
                        requests materials from the free lender libraries or
                        reciprocal libraries. If materials have charges or
                        fees, it is the responsibility of the borrower or
                        requestor to pay the charges imposed by the lending
                        libraries for loans or photocopies.</p>


                        <h3>Renewals</h3>


                        <ul>
                            <li>No renewal requests are made on overdue
                            materials. It is the patron's responsibility to
                            request a renewal, if needed, three days before the
                            due date.</li>


                            <li>Reciprocal loan arrangements with other
                            libraries allow for only one renewal request per
                            interlibrary loan item.</li>


                            <li>Some libraries do not grant any renewals.
                            Borrowed items from these libraries are stamped
                            "non renewable" on receipt in Interlibrary Loan so
                            the patron will be aware of the limitation when the
                            material is picked up.</li>
                        </ul>


                        <h3>Patron Responsibilities</h3>


                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Overdue Materials</strong>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>The interlibrary loan files are checked
                                    on a weekly basis for overdue items.</li>


                                    <li>First overdue notices are immediately
                                    sent to patrons for each item that is
                                    overdue. A fine of $.25 per day after the
                                    due date accrues for each item. There is a
                                    three day grace period which means patrons
                                    will not have to pay a fine if the items
                                    are returned one or three days after the
                                    due date. The fines for items returned four
                                    or more days after the due date will start
                                    accruing the day after the due date. A note
                                    indicating the $.25 per day overdue fine
                                    will be on the interlibrary loan
                                    identification strap.</li>


                                    <li>Faculty are exempt from paying overdue
                                    fines, but must pay replacement charges for
                                    lost or damaged books.</li>


                                    <li>Patrons are set deliquent in WorldCat
                                    when materials are one week overdue.
                                    Deliquent patrons may not charge out any
                                    Long Beach City College library materials
                                    until the overdue interlibrary loan item is
                                    returned.</li>


                                    <li>A patron with any overdue interlibrary
                                    loan material may not submit additional
                                    interlibrary loan requests or pick up items
                                    previously ordered until the overdue is
                                    cleared.</li>


                                    <li>A second overdue notice is sent when
                                    the item is two weeks overdue.</li>


                                    <li>A bill is sent when the item is three
                                    weeks overdue or if the item has been lost
                                    or damaged. Students will have a hold
                                    placed on their banner records, which means
                                    registration privileges are suspended.</li>


                                    <li>When the item(s) are returned and/or
                                    paid for, then the PAC and banner holds are
                                    lifted and all library and registration
                                    privileges are restored.</li>


                                    <li>In order to alleviate the problem of
                                    overdue materials, patrons will be allowed
                                    to renew or reorder copies of interlibrary
                                    loan materials currently in their
                                    possession seven days prior to the due date
                                    (or renewal date).</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>


                            <li>
                                <strong>Claims Returned</strong>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>If, after the first overdue notice is
                                    sent, the patron claims he/she has returned
                                    the item, then a complete investigation is
                                    carried out by an interlibrary loan staff
                                    member. The first step of the investigation
                                    is to check interlibrary loan's system
                                    records (OCLC) and paper records to see if
                                    the item has been returned. The second step
                                    is to ask the lending library if the item
                                    has been returned to them. The last step is
                                    to check the stacks.</li>


                                    <li>If the item is not found by the time
                                    the second overdue notice is sent, then a
                                    second investigation is carried out,
                                    repeating the steps carried out during the
                                    first investigation.</li>


                                    <li>If the item is not found after the
                                    second investigation, then the patron is
                                    held accountable for the item. A bill is
                                    sent to the patron and holds are placed on
                                    the patron's record, which means the
                                    patron's library and registration
                                    privileges are suspended.</li>
                                </ul>

                            <li>Lending libraries sometimes place restrictions

                            City College library patrons. Examples:

                                <ul>
                                    <li>For use in the library only</li>
