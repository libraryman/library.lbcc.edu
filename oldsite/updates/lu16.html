        <p align="left"> <font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">It's no secret 
          that the state's fiscal problems are causing public agencies throughout 
          California to cut back on services, impose new fees, and even shut down. 
          The College and the Library are no exception; we all know that student 
          fees are going up and money to support our programs is becoming harder 
          to find. Funding for the purchase of new books and media, for example, 
          never has been so sparse, and the funding we do have never so tenuous, 
          as in the current fiscal year.</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">It's heartening, then, to 
          be able to announce some good news. Despite this year's worsening budget 
          picture, the library has announced that in Spring, 2004 hours of access 
          to the library building will continue to be:</font></p>

            7 a.m. -10 p.m.<br>
            Friday 7 a.m. - 4 p.m.<br>
            Saturday 10 a.m. - 4 p.m. </font></p>

            Friday 8 a.m. - 2:30 p.m.<br>
            Saturday 10 a.m. - 2 p.m. </font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"> Both libraries are closed 
          on Sunday.</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">In announcing this decision, 
          LBCC Library Department Head Dele Ukwu noted that, even though the library 
          has been a leader in providing remote access to many of its information 
          resources (electronic books and full-text electronic journals), &quot;for 
          many of our students it continues to be very important to have a 'physical 
          library' in which to use print materials, consult with a librarian, 
          and study.&quot; &quot;We are here to serve the information needs of 
          the campus community,&quot; said Ukwu, &quot;and those needs don't stop 
          with our online databases. Having the library building open when students 
          and faculty need it is one of our top priorities.&quot; </font></p>
