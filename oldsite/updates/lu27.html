              to the LBCC Campus Community from Dele Ukwu, Library Department 
              Head</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">As academics, we know 
              and revere the central mission of libraries in the preservation, 
              organization, and delivery of recorded knowledge through civilizations 
              from West to East, from the Greco-Roman to the ancient civilizations 
              of Harrappa and Mohenjandaro. It is a mission that has evolved and 
              grown through centuries, and in colleges and universities it has 
              been made manifest through the library's fundamental support of 
              teaching and learning in all disciplines and at all levels. </font></p>
            <p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">At Long Beach City College 
              this proud tradition of service to students and faculty has been 
              maintained for over 75 years. I am writing you now because the library 
              is facing a crisis and is finding itself increasingly unable to 
              meet the basic needs and expectations of its constituents. One notable 
              example is the shocking erosion of funding for book purchases, money 
              needed to buy essential, current information resources across the 
              curriculum.<b><i> The library has had zero funding for books for 
              since 2003/04.</i></b> Although electronic subscriptions have helped 
              somewhat to mitigate this deficit, no one can deny that core collections 
              of up to date print materials are a critical need for any academic 
              library. </font></p>
            <p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">To address this need 
              I have authorized a direct appeal to you, our beneficiaries and 
              partners in education: the <b>LBCC Library Adopt-a-Book Campaign.</b> 
              I am making a special appeal to your philanthropy and generosity, 
              asking that you come to our aid as we grapple with the challenges 
              of an unfavorable economy. As the holidays approach, and as I conclude 
              my term as Library Department Head, I invite each of you to come 
              forward and contribute any amount, from five dollars to two hundred 
              dollars and more to restore our book purchasing power and replenish 
              and refresh our aging collections. Ongoing contributions designated 
              for the library through payroll deduction also are available. Either 
              way, these are tax-deductable investments in the library's future 
              that will benefit generations of students now and into the future.</font></p>
