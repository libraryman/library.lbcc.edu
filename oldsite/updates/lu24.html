              subscription to the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> online is available 
              to all LBCC students and faculty from any web-enabled computer through

              (password required-obtain from the Reference Desk at LAC or PCC 
              Library) Now this monumental reference work has been enhanced; the 
              latest update provides many useful new features, including:</font></p>
            <p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><b>EXPLORE OVER 1800 
              NEW AND REVISED WORDS...</b><br>
              The latest alphabetical range to be revised is ORB to OTTROYE. Coverage 
              is, as ever, broad -- everything from Japanese sumo terms such as 
              OSHI-DASHI and OSHI-TAOSHI to OTSEGO BASS (a US whitefish) and ORZO 
              (a type of pasta).</font></p>
            <p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><b>THE LATEST VOCABULARY...</b><br>
              Have BOTOX or the ATKINS made you BOOTYLICIOUS? Do you work in SOHO 
              (i.e. in the small business sector)? If so you probably don't work 
              for a TELCO. Perhaps you are a COMMENTARIAT or a PASHMINA-owning 
              member of the PUNDITOCRACY? Even if a REORG is planned, it may be 
              best not to give up your DAY JOB even though you would have more 
              time to play FOOSBALL or see a THREEQUEL! These are just some of 
              the many new words and phrases which have been added to OED Online 
              as part of the latest update.</font></p>
            <p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><b>NEW FEATURES...</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><b>* AUTHOR/BIBLIOGRAPHY 
              LINKING...</b><br>
              Quick look-ups from quotations to bibliography are now possible! 
              Many author names are clickable hyperlinks, and when selected launch 
              a new window displaying the OED bibliography for that author. This 
              means that the names and abbreviated work titles can be more easily 
              seen in their full form in order to identify them for further research 
              or library catalogue consultation. See <b><a href="http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00333390"><font size="-1" color="#990000">http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00333390</font></a></b> 
              for an example.</font></p>
            <p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><b>* LOST FOR WORDS...</b><br>
              Random browsing of OED entries is now available with the click of 
              a button! Simply click the Lost for Words icon (in the top navigation 
              bar next to the Find Word icon) on any page and start browsing!</font></p>
            <p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><b>* COUNTER-COMPLIANT 
              USAGE STATISTICS</b><br>
              OED usage statistics are now available in COUNTER-compliant format. 
              This is in addition to the existing detailed format and can be accessed 
              by a separate link to a new display summarizing searches and sessions. 
              All statistics are available from the Customer Service pages of 
              OED Online at <b><a href="http://dictionary.oed.com/services/" target="_blank"><font size="-1" color="#990000">http://dictionary.oed.com/services/</font></a></b>.</font></p>
            <p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><b>* OED WORD OF THE 
              DAY BY EMAIL</b><br>
              You can now sign up to receive the highly popular Oxford English 
              Dictionary Word of the Day by email! For today's word, and to sign 
              up, please go to <b><a href="http://www.oed.com/cgi/display/wotd" target="_blank"><font size="-1" color="#990000">http://www.oed.com/cgi/display/wotd</font></a></b>.</font></p>
            <p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><b>NEW ISSUE OF OED NEWS</b><br>
              The September issue of OED News is now available at http://dictionary.oed.com/newsletters/2004-09 
              and can be downloaded as a PDF file. Read about the work of the 
              all-important OED library researchers and the story of when an Associate 
              Editor of the OED was required to give evidence in court in a trade 
              description case. And you see the list of words for which the latest 
              research has revealed an earlier origin - such as ORBIT (c1425), 
              ORIGINALLY (1398), and ORDINARY (1402). As usual, the issue also 
              includes an appeal for help with particular words and phrases: for 
              example, what happened to &quot;pivot sheers&quot; between 1398 
              and 2004? Did anyone wear &quot;pirnies&quot; after 1910? And was 
              the phrase to &quot;throw one's toys out of the pram&quot; used 
              before 1989? If you can help, please e-mail oed3@oup.com. This month's 
              newsletter also includes a supplement to celebrate the life and 
              work of Robert Burchfield, editor of the Supplement to the OED, 
              who passed away on July 5, 2004.</font></p>
