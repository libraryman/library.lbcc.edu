<h2>LBCC Library Update</h2>
<h3>LU 37, March 23, 2007</h3>
<h1>How will CSULB Library&#8217;s Renovation Affect LBCC Students and Faculty?</h1>
<p><cite>by Henry DuBois</cite></p>

<p>Although both LBCC Libraries are scheduled to have newly constructed or remodeled buildings in the near future, at CSULB construction already has been underway since last May on a $31 million library renovation project.  Until now there have not been any restrictions resulting from this project on the agreement that makes it possible for  LBCC students and faculty borrow books and media at CSULB Library.</p>

<p>The second phase of construction at CSULB began March 15, however, and during this phase important parts of the library&#8216;s collection are now not accessible to library users. The library&#8216s second and third floor, including all books in the disciplines shown below are now located in a construction zone that has been closed to the public.  Books with call numbers from A to PQ are affected, including these subjects:</p>

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>
			<ul>
        	<li>Philosophy and religion</li>
        	<li>Psychology</li>
        	<li>Social Sciences</li>
        	<li>Business
        	<li>Law</li>
        	<li>Music</li>
      		</ul>
		</td>	
		<td>
			<ul>      	
      		<li>Art</li>
      		<li>Communication Studies</li>
      		<li>Theatre</li>
      		<li>Linguistics</li>
      		<li>Some languages and literature</li>
      		</ul>
		</td>
	</tr>

</table>

      
      
      
      
<p style="clear: left;">Although CSULB library staff will page books from the second and third floors needed by CSULB students and faculty, this service is <em>not</em> being made available to reciprocal borrowers, including the six local community colleges that CSULB Library &#8220;partners&#8221; with.</p>
      
<p><strong>What books and media <em>are</em> available to LBCC users?</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Science and technology</li>
        <li>Health and medicine</li>
        <li>English and American literature</li>
        <li>Mathematics</li>
        <li>Photography</li>
      </ul>
      
<p>DVDs and VHS videos, audiobooks, and audio CDs will continue to be available for checkout throughout construction.</p>

<p>These restrictions are expected to remain in force through the coming summer and perhaps into the early months of the fall, 2007 semester.  The final phase of the project, from approximately October, 2007 to March, 2008 will see the lists above reversed, with the books for the first group of subjects accessible once again and books on the subjects in the second group locked away in a construction zone.  The project at CSULB Library will be completed early in 2008; at that time full accessibility to all stack areas should be restored. </p>
