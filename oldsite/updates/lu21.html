      <p align="left"><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"> At LBCC Libraries, 
        as at all kinds of libraries worldwide, a transition is occurring that 
        will revolutionize scholarship. The library has evolved from a place that 
        stores paper documents into a catalyst that links students and faculty 
        with information in multiple formats located near and far. So too has 
        scholarly publication evolved, from paper newspapers and journals, to 
        words and images accessible over the web. </font></p>
      <p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">What does this transition mean 
        for libraries and their users?</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li> <font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">The number of paper subscriptions 
          will continue to decline as more and more content becomes accessible 
          over the web<br>
          </font> 
        <li><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"> The library will no longer 
          own most of its newspaper or journal content in perpetuity but will 
          lease that content by paid subscription; if the subscription isn't renewed 
          the content no longer can be made available</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">So why are libraries giving 
        up permanent ownership of content in favor of subscriptions that don't 
        offer that security and that could become unaffordable over time? What 
        advantages do e-journals and e-newspapers bring?</font></p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Anytime/anywhere access 
          to complete articles from any web-based computer<br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"> Ability to search content 
          multiple ways: author, title, keyword, date (including multiple years), 
          type of article, level of &quot;scholarship,&quot; limit to one or more 
          specific publications, etc.<br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Ability to &quot;cut and 
          paste&quot; content from an article into one's report or essay<br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Online help in citing references 
          from the journals and newspapers<br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"> Ability to mark relevant 
          articles and create a file of marked articles; option to E-mail, print, 
          and download content for maximum flexibility in dealing with articles 
          retrieve </font></li>
      </ul>
<font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Despite these important advantages, 
        libraries continue to struggle with their mandate to maintain an archive 
        of information that will survive through generations; digital information 
        can't yet guarantee the permanence of information &quot;carved in store,&quot; 
        or even that reproduced on acid free paper. Today few libraries can afford 
        to duplicate formats, to offer both the paper and the electronic versions 
        of a journal. Like LBCC, most have cast their lot with an electronic future, 
        even though that future doesn't offer all the safeguards that they would 
        like. <br>
