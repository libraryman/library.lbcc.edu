         <p> <font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Through a generous grant 
          from the LBCC Foundation the library is pleased to announce that digital 
          video discs (DVDs) soon will be among the information resources it provides 
          to the campus community. The $750 provided by the grant will be used 
          to select English and foreign language feature films which will be of 
          particular interest to students enrolled in music, film, and language 
          courses. The new collection is expected to be available for loan by 
          mid-May; it will be located near the elevators, adjacent to the existing 
          VHS video and audio CD collections. Library DVDs can be viewed in the 
          library or checked out for three days for viewing at home. </font></p>

              on the horizon for availability this semester is access through 
              the library to a landmark collection of over 4,100 electronic books. 
              Through a collaborative agreement with the California Community 
              College League, LBCC Libraries will share &quot;ownership&quot; 
              of these e-book titles, which support eleven subject disciplines, 
              plus vocational guidance and general reference. An online &quot;tour&quot; 
              of the e-book experience is available at:</font></b></font></td>

        <li><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><b>How will you check out 
          an e-book?</b></font> 
          <p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Look in Voyager, LBCC's 
            online catalog. E-books are listed, along with traditional books, 
            and like traditional books, searching can be by author, title, subject, 
            or keyword. If the book you want is an e-book, the catalog will say 
            so, and provide a link. Click on the link to display the book on your 
            desktop computer.</font></p>
        <li><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><b>If a book is checked 
          out by one library user, can another have it too?</b></font> 
          <p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">No, the same e-book, like 
            bound books, can't be used by two people at the same time, unless 
            the library has paid for multiple copies. </font></p>
        <li> <font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><b>If a lot of libraries 
          are sharing these titles, won't it mean that they're always checked 
          out?</b></font> 
          <p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">No, because the &quot;loan&quot; 
            period is much shorter than it is for traditional books. E-books are 
            checked out only during the period when they're in actual use. When 
            you're finished reading/consulting them, they're automatically checked 
            back in for others to use.</font></p>
        <li> 
          <font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Reading a book on my 
            pc doesn't sound very inviting-what's the advantage?</b></font>
<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">When a student is looking 
            for information on a topic for a research paper she/he finds books 
            on that topic, looks in the index to see what chapters and pages have 
            the information needed, and goes to those areas of the book to gather 
            the quotations, statistics, and other factual information to support 
            the paper's conclusion(s). Often these books are consulted, rather 
            than read from cover to cover. Similarly, manuals, guides, cookbooks, 
            dictionaries, and encyclopedias are used for short periods to extract 
            needed information. The library's e-books will serve the same needs, 
            and they'll have the advantage of &quot;anytime/anywhere&quot; availability. 
            Readers don't have to come to the library to read them, and note taking 
            can be done with cut-and-paste ease.</font></p>
        <li>
          <font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Can I print pages from 
            an e-book?</b></font>
<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Yes, individual pages and 
            excerpts can be saved and printed. Of course, copyright regulations 
            prohibit the printing or downloading of complete works.</font></p>
