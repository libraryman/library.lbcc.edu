	<h1>Unit 6: Online Research Databases</h1>
	
	<p>After completing this module, you will know how to:</p>
	
	<ul class="square">			
		<li>find and retrieve articles from Web-based databases</li>
		<li>familiarize yourself with various online research databases available from LBCC's library</li>			
	</ul>

	<hr />
	<h3>Definitions</h3>
	<p>As we do research we will come across words that we might not fully understand. Let's review some of these key research concepts.</p>	
	<p><strong>abstract</strong> - an abstract is a brief summary of the resource that highlights the main point of the work. You will usually see abstracts in relation to scholarly journal articles. Keep in mind that many of our databases might only search abstracts and return abstracts in the result set. You still need to access the full-text of the article, which may or may not be available electronically from the publisher. This is one reason we recommend when using ProQuest that you specify Full Text documents only.</p>
	<p><strong>bibliography</strong> - a list of resources that have been utilized/consulted for a particular purpose such as writing a paper, book, journal article, or website. Also known as works cited or references usually at the end of a paper, book, article.</p>
	<p><strong>citation</strong> - a reference to a particular resource (article, website, book, etc.) with the source of that information provided by author, title, publisher, and publication date. Citations are used in works cited/bibliographies.</p>
	<p><strong>primary source</strong> - a document that contains information written by an actual observer/participant of an event or one of the first people to record an event after it has occured. Examples: diaries, speeches, newspaper articles describing a particular event, interviews, letters. Good source of reference for historical research.</p>
	<p><strong>secondary source</strong> - a book, article or other resource that reports, analyzes, summarizes information gathered from primary sources.</p>
	<h3>Online Research Databases</h3>
	<p>Other than ProQuest, LBCC offers access to many other research databases. In this unit we will examine and work with a few of them. By now you should already be familiar with how to access these databases from the Library website. From the home page of the library, http://lib.lbcc.edu, select Articles & Databases from the left side navigation menu. If you are working off-campus be sure to authenticate to allow off-campus access to the databases by clicking on the "Off-Campus Access" link on the top right hand side of the list of databases available before proceeding.</p>
	<h4>Facts on File databases</h4>
	<img src="images/FOF1.gif" title="layout of Facts on File" border="0">
	<p>We offer access to several topics in our Facts on File databases. The topics include: American History, American Women's History, African-American History, American Indian History, Blooms Literary Reference, Career Guidance Center, Modern World History, Science Online, and the World Atlas. The interface for the Facts on File databases are similar and easy to use, offering a simple keyword search in the upper right corner and various ways to browse through the database. Advanced search options are also available by clicking the Advanced Search link in the center (under the HELP button).

<h4>CQ Researcher</h4>

<p>
<br><img src="images/CQ2.gif" title="issue tracker" border="0" align="right">
CQ Researcher is one of the "hot topics" research databases we will be exploring. CQ Researcher is published in print and online and has been known for its in-depth reports on current social issues since 1923. Unlike Facts on File which compiles documents from a variety of reference sources, CQ Researcher is written by a journalist that does research and writes the in-depth reports. Pay close attention to the date of the reports for relevancy. Also note the Issue Tracker which links related reports and other related topics. Searches can be done by using the Quick Search on the left, or you can browse through topics or dates of reports.</p>	
<h4>Opposing Viewpoints</h4>
<img src="images/OV1.gif" title="layout of Opposing Viewpoints" border="0">
<p>
One of our most used research databases is Opposing Viewpoints. If you were to visit the library you would see in our reference section an area titles "Hot Topics" and many books published by Opposing Viewpoints are shelved there. Many controversial topics, pros/cons, issues to debate make up these books. For the most up to date resources on hot topics, use Opposing Viewpoints. When you first enter the database you will see a list of the most popular issues. Browse through that list for your topic before doing a keyword search. Notice the tabs across the top of the results page. Your documents retrieved will be broken up into different document types - Viewpoints, Reference, Magazines, Academic Journals, News, Primary Sources, Statistics, Multimedia, Websites. Explore each tab for the different resources returned.</p>

<h4>SIRS Researcher</h4>
<p>Be sure to click on SIRS Researcher (there are three different databases to choose from). This database is similar in format to Opposing Viewpoints. Again you will have your hot social issues to choose or search with. My best advice for all research databases is to try to find your topic in their list, which generally brings you to an overview page that you can see the information that is available. From there you can finetune your results if you need more specific information by performing keyword searches using Boolean logic (AND, OR) to group your terms together. Please note when you do your search on the main page, the search defaults to SUBJECT HEADING rather than KEYWORD. Now that you know the difference between the two searches, keep that in mind. It is generally best to start with a keyword search because you might not know specifically what subject heading terms are being used to describe your topic.

</p>
<p>Good luck in your searches. Remember to take time in each of these databases and explore the different features that are available. Check out the HELP section to learn how best to use their system.</p>
