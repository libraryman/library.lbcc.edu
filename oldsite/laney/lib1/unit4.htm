	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<p>A reference book is usually not intended for consecutive reading; it is consulted for a discrete bit of information. For example, if you were looking for brief answers, such as the pronunciation of a word, a date of birth, or a statistic, you could probably find the information in an appropriate reference book. Dictionaries, directories, atlases, and almanacs are examples of reference books, which contain abundant information and discrete facts. Some reference books, such as encyclopedias, manuals, and document collections, contain more extensive information. A third type of reference work, indexes and bibliographies, simply refer you to sources where you could find information on a particular subject. The editors of such reference books have accumulated information from many sources and have put it in a format, which makes it more accessible. When you utilize these sources, you will discover that much of your work has already been done for you.</p>
	
	
	<p>Many reference sources start with an introductory section, stating the objectives, arrangement, and uses. Some reference works are arranged alphabetically; this is the easiest arrangement. When there is no alphabetical arrangement, an index is the essential pointer to the relevant bit of information. If you are not familiar with a particular reference tool, spend a few minutes to review briefly the introduction. This may avoid confusion at some future time.</p>
	
	<h3>Anatomy of a Reference Source</h3>
	
	<p>Most reference sources are arranged as follows:</p>

	
	<p>A. Starting points</p>
		<ul class="square">
			<li>a preface or an introduction stating the purpose of the reference work</li>
			<li> a how-to-use section</li>
			<li>a list of abbreviations and symbols</li>
		</ul>

		
	<p>B. Main section</p>
		<ul class="square">
			<li>This is where the reference information itself is located.</li>
		</ul>
		
	<p>C. Index</p>
		<ul class="square">
			<li>The index usually includes author, title, subject, keyword, and name index. The index is an essential guide to find a specific piece of information within the content of reference work.</li>

		</ul>
		
		<p>Before you approach a reference work, first consider your objective in using it. Does the reference book contain the information you need? What type and how much information are you seeking? How old is the reference book? How reliable are the authors or publishers? How is it arranged? Alphabetically? By topic? By date? Does it have indexes? How many? What kind? Does it have any special features, such as crossreferences of cumulated indexes?</p>
		
		<p>The following list of reference books is a fair representation rather than a comprehensive listing. The questions on the assignments are important not for their informational content but for their illustration of some features of a reference tool in order to familiarize you with its use.</p>

	<h3>Discipline-specific reference works</h3>
	
	<h4><a id="dictionaries" name="dictionaries"></a>Dictionaries and Encyclopedias</h4>

	<p>The most frequently used reference in the library is the dictionary. Some experts make a distinction between dictionaries and encyclopedias. They say a dictionary deals primarily with words, their meaning, spelling, pronunciation, derivation, syllabication, and grammatical usage, while an encyclopedia deals with information about the things named by the words. This distinction often breaks down, however, in many large dictionaries, which contain some information of an encyclopedic nature and much illustrative material. Certain dictionaries, because of their unique purpose, will not fit the foregoing description in some or any respects. They may deal exclusively with abbreviations or synonyms, or they may be restricted to slang terms or special subject matter, such as anthropology or economics. Such dictionaries cover information of an encyclopedic nature. For the purpose of this class, then, the distinction, though noted, is less important than what a particular dictionary or encyclopedia can do for you in your search for information.</p>
	
	
	<ul class="none">
		<li><strong><cite>The Oxford English Dictionary</cite></strong><br />Popularly known as the OED, it belongs to the family of historical origins dictionaries. The result of one of the most ambitious research projects in history, <cite>The Oxford English Dictionary</cite> provides the history of every word used in the English language since 1150. Arranged alphabetically, it gives the derivation, spellings, meanings, and various uses of each word. In addition, examples of the word's use are provided by a series of quotations beginning with its first known occurrence through current usage. When using this massive reference work, you should first acquaint yourselves with the page found in the front of each volume, which lists the abbreviations used.<br></li>
		
		<li><strong><cite>Third Barnhart Dictionary of New English</cite></strong><br />No language is static and in the 21st Century, with the massive scientific and technological advances and the explosion of the means of communication, such a statement was never more true. To keep up with this ever-increasing vocabulary, dictionaries of new words are being produced.<br />
Heavily used for information on recently coined terms that have been created by science, technology, popular culture, and society, this dictionary is a boon to individuals who encounter such terms. It is arranged alphabetically by term and includes pronunciations, definitions, etymologies, and frequency-usage notes. Every entry has quotations on the use of the word to clarify the meaning, and the quotations are footnoted with complete bibliographic information.</li>

	</ul>
	
	<h4><a id="subject" name="subject"></a>Subject-specific Dictionaries</h4>
	
	<p>In nearly every field of human interest, there is a vocabulary which is in some way unique. There is, therefore, a need for dictionaries in these fields to clarify what words&#151;and even symbols&#151;mean in the context of that subject.</p>
	
	<ul class="none">
		<li><strong><cite>Dictionary of Anthropology</cite></strong> (by Winick)<br />This is a good example of a specialized dictionary containing many terms not found in general dictionaries. Such dictionaries are essential to clarify the jargon of particular disciplines. Students, as well as laymen in the field, will find this an important desk reference. It is arranged alphabetically by keyword and has extensive crossreferences.<br></li>

		<li><strong><cite>Black's Law Dictionary</cite></strong><br />Considered the standard law dictionary, this work provides basic definitions of legal words and terms. Arrangement is alphabetical by term.<br></li>
		<li><strong><cite>Dictionary of American History</cite></strong><br />A good example of a reference work called a dictionary with all of the attributes of an encyclopedia, this scholarly work is exhaustive in its coverage of people, places, things, and events in American history. The arrangement is alphabetical, but the use of the index is essential to get full use of this excellent reference work.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4>Subject-specific Encyclopedias</h4>
	
	<p>Encyclopedias are an excellent source of general information on a number of subjects. Some encyclopedias, such as <cite>World Book Encyclopedia</cite>, have short information articles, while others, 
	such as the <cite>International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences</cite>, have extensive scholarly articles, usually with an analytical index. In the Liberal Arts Campus Library there are a number of excellent general encyclopedias, as well as those dedicated to special subject areas. Although you will be asked to review only one of the general encyclopedias, you might note those which are available for future reference. In the descriptions below, when mention is made to crossreferences, it means that there are citations within the articles or following them, referring the reader to other subjects within the work for additional information. In many cases, this supplements - but does not replace- the use of the index.</p>

	
	<ul class="none">
		<li><strong><cite>The Encyclopedia of Philosophy</cite></strong><br />This multivolume set offers long, authoritative articles, signed by the authors. It is comprehensive, attempting to cover all philosophies and periods. The arrangement is alphabetical by broad subject, and there is an index in the last volume. This reference includes discussions of individual philosophers, as well as ideas. Each article is accompanied by a bibliography.<br></li>
		<li><strong><cite>The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians</cite></strong><br />In every way, this reference work more closely fits the description of an encyclopedia than a dictionary. It contains articles on musical terms, musical history, theory and practice, instruments, musicians, and individual compositions, songs, and operas. It is a standard work on the subject covering the whole field from about 1450, with special emphasis on English music and musicians.<br></li>
		<li><strong><cite>McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science and Technology</cite></strong><br />With the exception of the behavioral and medical sciences, this encyclopedia covers all branches of science and technology. New developments are covered in annual supplements. The concise articles are written at about the same level as articles in <cite>Scientific American</cite> magazine. The signed articles cover both broad and specific areas of information. Concepts are often illustrated with photographs, drawings, and diagrams. The articles are crossreferenced and have short bibliographies. Arrangement is alphabetical by subject. Again, it should be emphasized, to best utilize this work, use the index volume.<br></li>

		<li><strong><cite>The Dictionary of Art (Grove)</cite></strong><br />In every way, this reference work is similar to its sister <cite>The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians</cite>, and more closely fits the description of an encyclopedia than a dictionary. In the words of the publisher, this is &quot;an illustrated reference work that provides comprehensive coverage of the history of all the visual arts worldwide, from prehistory to present time.&quot;</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4>To search for subject-specific encyclopedias and dictionaries</h4>
	<p>Log on to <cite><a title="Access Voyager online catalog" href="http://voyager.lbcc.edu">Voyager</a></cite>, the online catalog, and perform a subject search by typing the subject term, then the type of item as follows:</p>

	
	<p class="box">your subject--encyclopedias<br />your subject--dictionaries<br />your subject--handbooks</p>
	
	<p>For example:</p>
	
	<p>If you want to know if the library owns any encyclopedia of religion, type:</p>
<p class="box">Religion--encyclopedias</p>

	<p>If you want to know if the library owns any dictionary of anthropology, type:</p>

<p class="box">Anthropology--dictionaries</p>
<p>If you want to know if the library owns any handbook of physics, type:</p>

	<p class="box">Physics--handbooks</p>
	
	<h4>Ready-reference sources</h4>
	
	<p>In this module, we will concentrate on ready-reference sources that deal with facts. Librarians use ready-reference sources to answer factual questions from patrons. Facts may no longer be true; for example, a widely held belief in the 19th Century is often nullified by a twentieth century scientific discovery. A good way to verify the fact is to locate the original source. Most ready-reference sources, such as the <cite>World Almanac</cite>, cite their information sources. When evaluating a reference work, one should look for citations to original sources of information.</p>
	
	<p>The following list of reference books is a fair representation rather than a comprehensive listing. The questions on the assignments are important not for their informational content but for their illustration of some features of a reference tool in order to familiarize you with its use.</p>

	
	<h3><a id="almanacs" name="almanacs"></a>Almanacs, Yearbooks</h3>
	
	<p>Almanacs and yearbooks have different characteristics and formats; however, their scope and function are very similar, hence they are discussed together here as one common type of ready-reference source. The main difference is that the almanac contains retrospective material not often included in the yearbook.</p>
	
	<h4>Almanacs</h4>
	
	<p>Almanacs contain a great amount of facts and miscellaneous information in table and textual form. Since they are published annually, much of the information is associated with a single year, but modern almanacs are adding more and more historical information. Almanacs give such information as chronologies of events of the previous years, facts about countries and their governments, lots of statistics on populations, elections, economics, and lists of colleges, societies, associations, and famous people. This is a good place to look for awards and prizes, sports records, calendars, weather, sunrise times, and high-tide times. Since such compendiums of information do not lend themselves to an organized arrangement, the index is essential. There is, necessarily, a great deal of duplication of information in almanacs, but each will have unique information. Consequently, you often have to consult more than one almanac to find what you are looking for. Two of the most common almanacs are listed below. The <cite>World Almanac&apos;s</cite> index is found at the front of the book.</p>
	
	<ul class="none">

		<li><cite>Information Please Almanac</cite></li>
		<li><cite>World Almanac</cite></li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4>Yearbooks</h4>
	
	<p>A yearbook contains information about activities of countries, specialized fields, or subjects in a given year. Two of the most representative yearbooks are listed below. Please be aware that a number of different yearbooks exist.</p>
	
	<ul class="none">
		<li><strong><cite>Statesman's Yearbook</cite></strong><br />Considerable information on nations and international organizations is contained in this one-volume annual. Material on each nation includes a brief history and constitutional development, government, education, economics, agricultural production, and names of leaders. Brief statistical tables are included for each nation. The arrangement is topical: Part I, International Organizations; Part II, Commonwealth Nations; Part II, the United States (with a section on each state); and Part IV, the rest of the world. One unique feature is the section of Comparative Statistical Tables for such subjects as petroleum production and consumption, agricultural products, and territorial sea limits.<br></li>

		<li><strong><cite>The Europa World Year Book</cite></strong><br />
		<cite>Europa</cite> covers the same areas of the world in a slightly different format than are covered in the <cite>Statesman's Yearbook</cite>. It has two annual volumes. Volume I covers "International Organizations, Europe (including the USSR and Turkey)." Volume II covers "Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Australasia." Although duplicating some of the information contained in <cite>Statesman's Yearbook</cite>, these two references supplement each other because of their variant approaches and emphases. <cite>Europa's</cite> statistics for each nation, for instance, are much more complete, as are the directories of individuals.</li>
	</ul>

	
	<h3><a id="handbooks" name="handbooks"></a>Handbooks and Manuals</h3>
	
	<p>The terms handbooks and manuals are used interchangeably because of the difficulty in differentiating them. Most handbooks and manuals have a limited scope with emphasis on proven knowledge instead of current advances in research. Scientific handbooks are published primarily for specialists in a specific subject field, often with specialized language. The following reference books are difficult to categorize as dictionaries, encyclopedias, almanacs, or indexes, though they may contain collections of information that might be considered as encompassing several of these types of reference works. They contain a wealth of information and are often the first place you should look for certain subjects or certain types of information. Please be aware that these books are just a few representatives of the library's ready-reference collection.</p>

	<ul class="none">
		<li><strong><cite>Masterplots</cite></strong><br />This multivolume set contains abstracts on the great literary works of the world. Each entry includes such information as type of work, locale, principal characters, summary, and critique. Arrangement is alphabetical by title of work. This reference obviously will not replace reading a classic, but it can provide a quick refresher of characters and plots.<br></li>
		<li><strong><cite>Bartlett's Familiar Quotations</cite></strong><br />Found in nearly every reference collection, this work is one of many very useful collections of quotations that identify who said or wrote familiar quotations. It can also provide you with a quotation on a subject of interest to you. Some quotation books organize quotations alphabetically by subject or author. In terms of organization, <cite>Bartlett's</cite> is unique. It arranges quotations by author, not alphabetically, but chronologically by date of birth. This is because the editors consider the time frame to be an important addition to this type of reference. An author and extensive subject index, however, provide access from those points of view.<br></li>

		<li><strong><cite>CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics</cite></strong><br /> This work, revised almost annually, contains a massive amount of mathematical and chemical information in tabular form. The extensive index is arranged by broad subjects. It is a source for information such as logarithms, square roots, molecular weight, and formulas.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3><a id="biographical" name="biographical"></a>Biographical sources</h3>
	
	<p>To locate a comprehensive biography on an individual, the library catalog would be the obvious place to look. However, if a date of birth, a bibliography of writings, a current address, or other discrete facts are desired, there are a number of reference works that would better serve your needs. Reference books also frequently provide access to information about a person when the library has no complete biography. The following biographical sources are probably the most frequently consulted, but it will often pay for you to seek help from the reference librarian in locating biographical material beyond the obvious sources.</p>
	
	<ul class="none">
		<li><strong><cite>Biography Index</cite></strong><br />Perhaps more appropriately described in the section on indexes, this is another excellent Wilson publication. It contains no biographical information per se; it refers you to sources where you can find information. It indexes biographical material available in periodicals, individual biographies, and collected biographies, such as &quot;Ten Scientists Who Changed the World.&quot; Cumulated in an annual volume, this index is considered to be a periodical. An added feature is the index which lists the subjects of biography by such classifications as profession and race.<br></li>

		<li><strong><cite>American National Biography</cite></strong><br />Scholarly essays by experts, often several pages long, make up this multivolume set. It is considered the most authoritative and famous of all American biographical sources.<br></li>
		<li><strong><cite>Current Biography</cite></strong> <br/>
					One- or two-page biographical sketches with portraits are contained in this heavily used reference work. A short list of references appears at the end of each entry. Subjects are persons from all professions&#151;theater, sports, medicine, politics, business, music, etc. Although all nationalities are covered, the bulk of the entries are for Americans. <cite>Current Biography</cite> is a monthly publication, but it is cumulated into an annual volume. Dating from 1940, it has a 45-year index and 10-year cumulative indexes.<br></li>
		<li><strong><cite>Contemporary Authors</cite></strong><br />The subtitle, &quot;a bio-bibliographical guide to current authors and their work,&quot; identifies the scope of this reference work. Cumulated into semiannual volumes with various revisions, this work includes brief personal information, career highlights, a bibliography of the author's work, and often, work in progress, as well as a short statement by the author. Arrangement is alphabetical in each volume. Since the publishers have produced several series, the use of the cumulative index is very important. This work also indexes <cite>Contemporary Literary Criticism</cite>, produced by the same publishers.</li>

	</ul>
	
	<h3><a id="directories" name="directories"></a>Directories</h3>
	
	<ul class="none">
		<li><strong><cite>Encyclopedia of Associations</cite></strong> <br/>
					This directory lists &quot;nonprofit American membership organizations of national scope.&quot; Each entry includes such information as current address and telephone number, year founded, membership, staff, purpose, meetings and conventions, and publications. Arrangement is by very general areas of interest, so use of the organization name and keyword index is very important. If you have a hobby or special interest or just want more information on one, this should often be the place to start your search.<br></li>

		<li><strong><cite>Official Congressional Directory</cite></strong> <br/>This directory includes information on departments, commissions, independent agencies, and the judiciary, as well as material on Congress and its functions. This is a major source of biographies for members of Congress. New congressmen, lobbyists, newsmen, or anyone else seeking information on Congress and its operation in the nation's capitol would find this reference indispensable. Arrangement is topical. An alphabetical content listing is at the front of the book, and an index of individuals at the end.<br></li>
		<li><strong><cite>Gale Directory of Publications</cite></strong> <br/>The main list, arranged by state, then city, then publication, covers nearly a 1,000 pages and gives the following information: 1) some descriptive and statistical matter about each state; a list of its counties, marking those which have no newspapers; and considerable gazetteer information about each city&#151;its distance and direction from some important place, its railroads, leading manufactures, products, and institutions, and 2) detailed information about each paper or periodical listed, including its name, frequency, character or politics, date of foundation, size of column and page, subscription price, circulation figures, names of editors and publishers. It has a number of classified lists and an alphabetical index of periodicals and newspapers at the end.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3><a id="atlases" name="atlases"></a>Atlases and Gazetteers</h3>
	
	<p>An <strong>atlas</strong> is a reference book providing maps, plates, engravings, or charts with or without explanatory text. It is sometimes used as the name of a volume in which subjects are presented in tabular form. While it is generally recognized that atlases are essential in studying history, geography, and other branches of the social sciences, it is becoming increasingly apparent that many atlases are valuable also as general reference books, because of the descriptive materials they contain in addition to maps.</p>

	<p>A <strong>gazetteer</strong> is a dictionary of geographical places. In addition to geographic location, it gives historical, statistical, cultural, and other relevant information about these places. It may also indicate pronunciation. Because they provide a variety of factual materials about places, gazetteers are important reference sources. Recent editions describe a place as it is now; old editions give historical information about it. Therefore, the economic growth or decline of a town or city, as indicated by data on population, number of industries, schools, etc., will often be shown by the facts given in the gazetteers over a period of time. So, it is important to note the copyright date to get some indication about the currency of the material. A few of the most popular atlases and gazetteers are listed below.</p>
	
	<ul class="none">
		<li><strong><cite>Rand McNally Commercial Atlas and Marketing Guide</cite></strong> <br/>
					This atlas is used extensively by manufacturing and sales organizations. It is revised annually and is noted for its accurate and current commercial information. Emphasis is on the United States, but it has a small foreign section. Arrangement is alphabetical by state with each one individually indexed. The state maps are accompanied by a number of tables indicating such commercial features as population, industries, agricultural production, and sales data.<br></li>
		<li><strong><cite>Times Atlas of the World</cite></strong> <br/>

					Considered by many to be the most authoritative and comprehensive atlas in print, this is a new edition of a reference dating back to 1920. The introductory material is encyclopedic in its approach. The maps are surprisingly clear, considering the massive number of place names they contain. Elevation is indicated by color toning. In addition to the Table of Contents, the &quot;Key to Map Plates&quot; provides easy access to the maps. This atlas is justifiably famous for its comprehensive index. In addition to plate locations, it provides latitude and longitude for each place named.<br></li>
		<li><strong><cite>Columbia-Lippincott Gazetteer</cite></strong> <br/>
					Of worldwide scope, this three-volume set lists countries, regions, cities, physical features, etc. The entries cover such brief information as pronunciation, population, location, and key dates. If you need brief facts about a geographical location, this is the place to look.</li>
