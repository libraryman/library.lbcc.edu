	<h1>Unit 2: Navigating the Library and Classification Systems </h1>

    <p>After completing this module, you will know how to: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>describe a functional arrangement common to many libraries </li>
      <li>perform various kinds of searches to find information in the online catalog </li>
      <li>explain what Boolean searching is and compose a search statement using logical operators </li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h2><a name="arrangement">Library Arrangement </a></h2>
    <p>The Liberal Arts Campus Library at Long Beach City College, like a majority of academic libraries, is arranged according to function—that is, according to what happens in a particular area. </p>
    <h4>Circulation Area </h4>
    <p><img src="images/circ.gif" border="0" alt="circulation desk" align="left">The Circulation Desk is usually located near the library entrance. Here, the material students want to check out is charged to them. There are a number of systems for such a procedure, but each is designed to assign individual responsibility for charged material. In most libraries, the exit is controlled in order that all users pass a checkpoint to ensure that no library material is being removed without first having been charged out. </p>
    <h4>Reserve Room </h4>
    <p>Instructors frequently set up a reading assignment for an entire class. If there are limited copies of the assigned material, one copy will often be placed in a reserve collection, where it can be checked out for a limited period of time, usually a couple of hours or overnight, depending on the length of the assignment, availability of the material, and demand by students. In addition to books, instructors may place periodicals, pamphlets, and even individual articles on reserve under their own name. Sometimes, instructors will place personal copies of material they own on reserve, so that it can be shared with the class. At LBCC Library, students can identify reserve material in the online catalog, where it is indexed under the instructor's name and course number. </p>
    <h4>Reference Room </h4>
    <p>Some books are used so extensively for reference purposes that they cannot be checked out of the library. Included in this group of books are resources, such as dictionaries, encyclopedias, indexes, and atlases. They are shelved in a separate area known as the Reference Room. The Reference Desk, frequently located in the Reference Room, is staffed by librarians, who are prepared to assist students with their information needs. In the Reference Room, talking is kept as brief and quiet as possible, so as not to disturb people engaged in research and study. </p>
    <h4>Periodical Collection </h4>
    <p><img src="images/periodicals.gif" border="0" alt="periodicals" align="left">Another form of current information is the periodical. Popular magazines, specialized journals, and newspapers are included in a periodical collection. Many academic libraries maintain their periodicals in a separate area. At the Liberal Arts Campus Library, the Periodical Room has a full-time staff to provide students with assistance in locating material. If no staff person is currently attending the Periodical Room, students may ask the librarian at the Reference Desk for help in using the periodicals. Some periodical titles are maintained permanently, while others are discarded after their usefulness has expired. The length of time that any title is held varies according to the subject content and interest. Due to the renovation of the LAC campus library, the periodicals collection is housed in the TU portable, the closest portable to where the library building is. </p>
    <p>Back issues are kept in a number of formats. Many are bound, and they look like books. They are shelved in the Periodical Room, and they are filed by call number, so that periodicals on similar subects are shelved adjacent to each other. </p>
    <p>Increasingly, libraries are becoming dependent upon microforms to maintain their periodical collections. Material from books, manuscripts, and special collections may also be stored on microform. Some libraries with large microform holdings even maintain a separate area for these holdings and the machines that are used with them. In all microforms, the image is photographically reduced in size. An entire shelf of material might be stored on one small reel or on several cards. Microfilm is a film transparency on a reel, which usually measures 35 millimeters. Microfiche is a transparency card, generally four-by-six inches in size. Students may use machine readers to view the contents of microfiche or microfilm. These machines shine a light through the transparent film and cast the image on a screen. There are many kinds of readers; some are manually operated, and others are automatically operated. They all work on the same principle and, are they are relatively simple to use. The LBCC Library has microfilm and microfiche reader-printers, which produce printouts at a cost of $.20 per page. </p>
    <p>A large amount of our periodicals are available online in many of our online databases which we will be learning about in Unit 5. One of the most popular online database for periodicals is ProQuest. ProQuest can search full-text through numerous databases and return an electronic text version of a magazine, newspaper, or journal article. Many articles are even available in high quality pdf formats, which are an actual scan of the page from the periodical the article is contained in. </p>
    <p>A number of indexes, some in print and others in electronic format, help students identify articles on a particular subject. Print indexes are shelved on tables in the Reference Room; electronic indexes are accessed in the library's licensed databases. </p>
    <h4>Media Services </h4>
    <p>Educational institutions utilize nonprint materials as supplementary tools in the learning process. In fact, colleges are generally expanding their nonprint collections, comprised of videocassettes, filmstrips, audiocassettes, records, DVDs, and compact discs. With nonprint collections, there is a need for considerable audiovisual equipment, which provides access to this material. Whether it is housed in the library or somewhere else on campus, nonprint materials require special knowledge and handling. The result is often a separate Media Department within the library, staffed with professionals concerned with the informational content and production of material, and technicians concerned with maintaining and booking the equipment. Nonprint material is an integral part of individual self-instruction, and computer-assisted instruction in the form of interactive, multimedia programs are used prominently in academic libraries. LBCC's media services is temporarily housed in the TU portable on the LAC campus during the library renovation. </p>

<h2>Classification Systems</h2>
<p><img src="images/lcclass2.gif" border="0" title="Books with Library of Congress classification label" align="right">Libraries organize their materials by using classification systems. The two main classification systems are the Dewey Decimal System and the Library of Congress system. Each system utilizes subject headings to organize resources. Subject headings are created by a cataloger who defines the language and words that represent the subject (called controlled vocabulary). Resources are assigned between one and five subject headings and arranged by the corresponding call numbers for the dominant subject. These call numbers are generally found on the spine of the book. When you use an online catalog system you search for your resources by keyword, title, author name or subject. Once you find a resource that looks relevant, you record the call number and go to the book stacks to locate your resource. </P>
<h4>Dewey Decimal Classification</h4>
<p>This was, for many years, the most common classification system used by libraries, and it is still used by many public and school libraries today.</p>
<p>Dewey developed his system predicated on the idea that the major areas of knowledge could be divided into ten major divisions of three-digit numbers (000, 100, 200, etc. to 900). For example, all of the numbers between 500 and 599 deal with some aspect of a single subject ­ pure science. Each of these divisions is, in turn, divided into ten subdivisions (510, 520, 530, etc.). Any book, then, with the exception of fiction, is classified with a number between 001 and 999.</p>
<p>Since greater refinement is often necessary, a further series of decimal numbers is employed to increase the distinction in subject matter. At times, the use of decimal numbers causes difficulty for library users and perpetuates the myth that there is some mystery that only librarians can fathom in locating a classified book. However, once students understand the use of decimals, there is no mystery to the sequence.</p>
<p>Every Dewey number has at least three digits. They are shelved in a numerical sequence. Thus, 001 precedes 099, which precedes 100.</p>
<p>Any digits, which follow the first three, are decimal numbers. Thus, in the classification numbers 910.305 and 910.35, the digits following the decimals (.305 and .35) are arranged decimally, rather than numerically. Thus:</p>
<p>910 precedes 910.09, then 910.3, then 910.305, then 910.35.</p>
<h4>Library of Congress Classification (LC)</h4>
<p>LC is a classification system established by the United States Library of Congress, and it is the preferred classification system of academic and research libraries. Since the Library of Congress utilizes most of the letters of the alphabet for major divisions, a second letter for subdivisions, and a series of numbers for further refinement, the possibilities for expansion are much greater than with the Dewey Classification system.</p>
<p>Students familiar with the decimal classification are sometimes confused by the use of letters. Overall, students tend to find the Library of Congress Classification a simpler system, once they discover that it, too, is merely a sequence utilizing letters, as well as numbers.</p>
<p>Accordingly, D precedes DA; DA precedes DC; DC precedes DD; DD precedes E, etc.</p>
D 9 .B7<br>
D 31 .G51<br>
D 301 .A3<br>
D 1001 .F3<br>
DA 1 .A32<br>
<p>Occasionally, a decimal number appears in a Library of Congress Classification number. It is, of course, shelved decimally.</p> 
<p>Thus:<br>
D 8410 precedes<br>
D 8410.12 which precedes<br>D 8410.5 and before<br>
D841</p>
<p>Most academic libraries use the Library of Congress classification system while most public libraries use the Dewey Decimal system. The LBCC library utilizes the Library of Congress classification system. The Dewey Decimal system is recognizable because it is in numeric notation while the Library of Congress system has the first 1 to 3 characters represented by letters dividing the subjects and then numbers to further represent the specific topic. For instance, if we wanted to look up the topic Buddhism in the Dewey Decimal system, the call number would be 294.3 while in the Library of Congress system, BQ4002 is the call number.</p>
<h4>Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH)</h4>

<p>The Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) refers to a set of four large red books, usually shelved in a library's Reference Collection.<img src="images/subjectHead.jpg" border="0" title="Subject Heading Red Books" align="left"></p>

<p>The LCSH is based on the concept of "controlled vocabulary." When searching for information from print indexes or card catalogs, the searcher's subject terms must match those of the indexer. For example, if the searcher finds no items indexed under the term "death penalty," it is because the indexer uses a different term, in this case "capital punishment." Sometimes, crossreferences lead a searcher to the correct term to use. Hence, the system is predicated on a set of standard subject headings to assign to concepts—a sort of common language.</p>

<p>The LCSH was created to fill the need for a controlled vocabulary of subject headings, upon which indexers and catalogers rely to find the proper terminology for indexing and cataloging library materials. LCSH establishes a controlled-vocabulary environment with predetermined subject headings.</p>

<p>The LCSH is updated regularly to reflect changes in language and culture. For example, the following subject headings, reflecting changes in American life and culture, were recently added: AIDS, Internet, and cyberpunk.</p>

<p>Subject headings are listed in boldface type, e.g., <strong>Motorboats, Agricultural machinery, Drugs</strong>. A heading may be followed by the note, (May Subd Geog), indicating that the heading may be subdivided into geographic locations. Subject headings may consist of one word or several words. A one-word heading often consists of a noun, e.g., Motorboats; two-word headings are usually composed of an adjective and a noun, e.g. Agricultural machinery.</p>

<p>Subject headings often include abbreviations denoting hierarchical relationships between various topics. It's important for you to become familiar with these abbreviations. Refer to the introductory chapter at the beginning of a volume in the LCSH set to learn how to interpret the entries. In general, it is a good habit to consult the how-to-use section of a reference work before attempting to use it. The how-to-use section may consist of an instructional preface or introduction.</p>
<p>Here is an example of an entry from the Library of Congress Subject Headings:</p>
<strong>
Agricultural machinery (May Subd Geog)<br>
[S671-S760]<br>
UF Agriculture - Equipment and supplies<br>
Crops - Machinery<br>
Farm machinery<br>
BT Machinery<br>
RT Farm equipment<br>
Farm mechanization<br>
Machine-tractor stations<br>
SA subdivision Machinery under names of<br>
crops, e.g. Corn - Machinery<br>
NT Agricultural implements<br>
Agricultural instruments<br></strong>

<p>In the example above outlining the subject heading "Agricultural machinery," we see that this term may be subdivided geographically, as indicated by the note "(May Subd Geog)." Furthermore, [S671-S760] indicates the class number to use when cataloging books in this subject matter. Here is the meaning of the following abbreviations:</p>

<p><strong>UF</strong> indicates that the heading "Agricultural machinery" is <strong>Used For</strong> those listed after UF, i.e., "Agriculture - Equipment and supplies," "Crops - Machinery," "Farm machinery"</p>

<p><strong>BT</strong> indicates that the <strong>Broader Topic</strong> for "Agricultural machinery" is "Machinery"</p>

<p><strong>RT</strong> indicates that the <strong>Related Topic</strong> for "Agricultural machinery" is "Farm equipment," "Farm mechanization," and "Machine-tractor stations"</p>

<p><strong>SA</strong> refers to those subjects which a user could "<strong>See Also</strong>"</p>

<p><strong>NT</strong> indicates that the <strong>Narrower Topic</strong> for "Agricultural machinery" is "Agricultural implements," "Agricultural instruments"</p>

<p>Let's look at one example of a hierarchical relationship:</p>
<strong>
Vehicles<br>
BT Transportation<br>
NT Motor vehicles<br>
Motor vehicles<br>
BT Vehicles<br>
NT Trucks<br>
Trucks<br>
BT Motor vehicles<br>
NT Dump trucks<br>
Dump trucks<br>
BT Trucks<br></strong>

<p>The hierarchical tree above provides a clearly defined organization of the tree-like structure for the subject term "Transportation." The branches of the tree, so to speak, are reprersented by the terms "Vehicles" and "Motor vehicles." And the twigs are "Trucks" and "Dump trucks." This example illustrates the way in which users can follow the hierarchy from the narrowest topic, "Dump trucks," to the broadest topic, "Transportation."</p>
<p>Some of the subject headings were created in the late 1800's and may not use common language of today. Therefore it is important to remember when searching for your research terms, that you pay attention to your search type. Notice if your search is selected for KEYWORD or SUBJECT HEADING. Keyword searches are for natural language and will search various areas of the resource - such as the title, author, citation, but subject heading searches are for exact language for the controlled vocabulary. As an example, if you wanted to search for a reference book on a list of movies and you types MOVIE in with the SUBJECT HEADING search selected, you would return no results. The subject heading you would want to use is motion pictures. However, if you were searching with a keyword search, movie would produce many more search results. A complete list of subject headings can be found in the red Library of Congress subject headings reference books located in the LBCC libraries.</p>
