	<h1>Introduction to the Research Process</h1>

After completing this module, you will know how to:<br>
<br>
    * define your research topic<br>
    * determine your information needs<br>
    * locate and retrieve relevant information<br>

<h1>What is Research?</h1>
You do research on a daily basis. Think about it. When you have a question about something, anything, and you want to find the answer, you do research. Say you wanted to find where the closest movie theatre is to your house and what is playing there. Chances are you know how to do that. Perhaps you go to your favorite movie searching website and look it up. Maybe you pick up the phone book and call. You are searching for information, finding an answer to a question you have. Small or large, you are doing research.<br><br>
In college, research is more extensive. Perhaps you are taking a class and you have to write a paper on a social issue of your choice. Your instructor does not decide the research topic for you. Where and how would you start?<br><br>
This class will help you answer that question and provide you a roadmap to do your research. Let's breakdown the steps of research to the following:<br>
<br>
1. Choose a Topic<br>
2. Locate Resources for your Topic<br>
3. Evaluate your Resources<br>
4. Determing which Resources to Use<br>
5. Write your Research Paper<br>
6. Cite your Resources<br>
<br>
This unit will focus on Step 1: Choose a Topic. In this course you will be creating a research guide, essentially you will be preparing a guide that will instruct others how to start their research on the topic you have chosen. You will NOT be writing a paper, only creating a list of sources as an example for someone else who might be writing a paper on that topic. Later in the course we will look at examples of research guides so you have a better idea of what you will be creating. For now, let's think about a topic.
<br><br>
For the purpose of this class research guide, you will be choosing a social issue/controversial topic. Examples might be abortion, death penalty, global warming, legalization of marijuana, same-sex marriage, etc. 
<h1>Choose a Topic</h1>
Sometimes the hardest part of research is deciding on a topic. Fortunately, there are a number of reference sources in the library that might inspire you with a suitable topic. Opposing Viewpoints, SIRS Researcher, CQ Researcher, and Facts.com's Issues and Controversies on File are such works. They treat current, controversial topics, and they both have excellent indexes. 
<h1>Identifying Concepts</h1>
After deciding on your topic, write it down as a search statement with at least two identifying concepts. You may need to narrow your topic. The following questions may help you accomplish this task and assist you in formulating a search query:
<br>
<br>
    * Is your topic brand new or has it been discussed over a number of years?<br>
    * Is your topic global or is it relevant only to the United States?<br>
    * Is there a person, a group, or an institution involved in your topic?<br>
<br>
Here is an example of a topic statement with a clearly defined point of view:<br>
<br>
Animal testing is a necessary cost for the greater benefits of mankind.
<br>
<br>
Here is an example of the search process. Notice that the main concepts are identified first, followed by possible synonyms or related concepts, which you could build into your search statement.<br>
<br>
Concept #1 	  	Concept #2 	  	Concept #3<br>
animal testing 	AND 	benefits 	AND 	humanity<br>
<br>
Here is a second example using synonyms or related concepts:<br>
Concept #1 	  	Concept #2 	  	Concept #3<br>
animal rights 	AND 	cost 	AND 	human lives<br>
<br>
And here is a third example using synonyms or related concepts:<br>
Concept #1 	  	Concept #2 	  	Concept #3<br>
animal protection 	AND 	price 	AND 	human beings<br>
<br>
<h1>Determining Information Needs</h1>

The scope and type of your assignment dictate your information needs. The following points may help you focus on the information you need to complete your research:<br>
<br>
    * Type of assignment (e.g. short essay versus final project)<br>
    * Currency of information (is this criterion relevant or irrelevant to your research?)<br>
    * Type of information (overview versus in-depth study)<br>
    * Type of publication (popular magazines versus scholarly journals)<br>
    * Type of format (print, audio, electronic, etc.)<br>
    * Viewpoint (neutral versus partisan viewpoints)<br>
<br>

<h1>Locating and Retrieving Relevant Information</h1>

Once you have determined your information needs, the next step is to locate and retrieve relevant information, using appropriate resources. Libraries have excellent on-site and online resources for users' research needs. Over the coming weeks, we will learn about these reference resources and how to use them. Reference sources provide an excellent overview and background information on a particular subject. Information comes in various types (e.g., books and periodical articles) and formats (e.g., print and electronic). Depending on your information needs, you may only need to use reference works, in-depth books, or both books and periodical articles to complete your research paper. Internet resources are included as acceptable sources of information.<br>
