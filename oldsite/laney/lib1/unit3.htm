	<h1>Unit 3: Search Strategies, Finding Books and E-Books </h1>

    <p>After completing this module, you will know how to: </p>
    <ul>		
		<li>explain what Boolean searching is and compose a search statement using logical operators </li>   
		<li>perform various kinds of searches to find information in the online catalog </li>  
    </ul>
    <br>
	  <h2>Search Strategies </h2>
	<p>Before we start searching for resources for our topic, we need to learn about proper search strategies. One strategy that is very helpful and allows us to narrow or broaden our search results is called Boolean searching.
</p>
	<p>The two Boolean searches we will be using most will be the operators AND and OR. The AND operator is used to narrow your results. This operator tells the database to search for items that only include the words between the AND operator. The OR operator is used to broaden your results. This operator tells the database to search for items that have any or all of the words between the OR operator. </p>
	<p>Why would we want to use Boolean searching? Think back to your synonyms that you came up with for your research topic. One of the reasons you did that was to build better searches. You connect your synonyms with the OR operator. </p>
	<p>Let's say I wanted to search for articles that mention President Bush. I go to the search screen and in the box I type the word<em> Bush</em>. What sort of results am I going to come up wiht if that is all I search for? I'll get all sorts of results - ranging from landscaping, to the rock band Bush, to the President. What could I type to limit my results to only include President Bush? Note the hint there -- I want to LIMIT my results. I want my results to be narrowed, not broadened. Therefore, I want to use the AND operator. Perhaps I try my search now with the words <em>Bush AND President</em>. That should remove any references to landscaping or the rock band Bush. </p>
	<p>Another example: If you are doing research on teenage drug abuse you might want to use your synonyms. Let's think of some synonyms for the word teenage -  Youth, Young Adults. And for the word drug abuse - drug use, drugs. Now let's build our search. </p>
	<p><em>(Teenage OR  Youth OR Young Adults) AND (drug abuse OR drug use OR drugs)</em>. </p>
	<p><img src="http://ezlrnp.lbcc.edu/ezlrnCourses/libdl/lib1oldl/media/boolean.jpg" width="500" height="500"> </p>
	<br>
	<h4>Searching for Phrases</h4>
	<p>When you type in your search terms, the search tool tries to find the best matches for you. They will look for your terms in a specific document, website, etc. but they can be anywhere in the document and might not be exactly what you are looking for. If you want to search for a specific phrase, it is better to search for the phrase by putting it in quotations. This tells the search tool to look for those words in that particular order. Be careful that you have the phrase correct or you might not return any results. </p>
	<p> Perhaps you heard a song on the radio and didn't catch the title or artist. Or you are looking for that poem you really enjoyed but can't remember anything but one line from it. Search for these phrases with quotation marks around them and the search tool will look specifically for that order of words. </p>
	<br>
<h2>The Library's Online Catalog</h2>
<p>Every library has, in some form, a list of its holdings, designed to give users ways to find every cataloged item, if they know the author, title, or subject of the book, record, film, or other type of item they seek. Such a list is called the catalog, comprised of catalog entries or citations.</p>

<p>In the old days of card catalogs, each catalog entry, describing a single library item, was usually typed or printed on a 3-by-5-inch card (hence the name card catalog). With the advent of computerized or online catalogs, a single catalog entry is called a record. In the computer environment, databases are organized into files; files are made up of records; and records are made up of fields. Thus, a bibliographic record is a computerized description of a single item in a collection or a database. In library jargon, each catalog entry is referred to as a bibliographic record, and it contains information about a single document or item in the library. The item could be a pamphlet, a book, a video, or a music CD, for example.</p>

<p>The online environment provides a number of access points to a document. This means that users may search for an item in the library not only by author's name, title, subject (as with the card catalog), but they may also search by keyword, call number, ISBN, and other fields.</p>

<p>A bibliographic record provides a description that uniquely identifies an item. The description includes, but is not limited to the following fields:</p>

    * Author<br>   
   	* Title<br>
   	* Edition<br>
   	* Date of publication<br>
   	* Place of publication<br>
   	* Publisher<br>
   	* Series<br>
   	* Physical description (e.g., number of pages, measurements, illustrations, etc.)<br>

<p>Users must know how to interpret a bibliographic record and identify all the essential elements in order to cite an item according to a standard documentation style, such as MLA (Modern Language Association) and APA (American Psychological Association).</p>

<h2>Voyager, LBCC Library's Online Catalog</h2>

<p>The online catalog shared by the Long Beach City College libraries is known as "Voyager." It is a Web-based catalog, meaning that users may access it over the World Wide Web. Voyager enables users to perform the following types of searches:</p>

* Keyword search<br>
* Title search<br>
* Author search<br>
* Command keyword search (Boolean search)<br>
* Subject heading search<br>
* Periodicals search<br>
* Subject phrase search<br>
* Call number search<br>

<p>The logic behind the Voyager system generally applies to other library systems. While online catalogs may use different commands, they are based on a similar logic. Once you learn how to search the online catalog at Long Beach City College, you will find it easy to search the catalogs at Long Beach Public Library, California State University Long Beach, and other libraries. In this course, we will follow standard terminology by using the term "document" to indicate an item in the library's collection. Documents, therefore, may be books, videos, compact discs, pamphlets, etc. Likewise, the term "record" is used to indicate an entry from the results list of an online information-retrieval system, whether it is the library's online catalog or one of the library's licensed databases.</p>


	
	<h1>Using the Library Online Catalog - Voyager</h1>
	
	<h2>Simple Search</h2>
	<img src="images/simple.jpg" alt="image of simple search screen" style="float: left; margin-top: -10px; margin-bottom: 10px; border: 1px solid #000;" />
	<p style="clear: left;"><cite>Voyager</cite> provides you with many search options. The image above represents the screen used to input a simple search. Notice the light grayed-out tab on the top left, which indicates that you are now in the Simple Search mode.</p>

	
	<p>Select a search option from the drop-down menu on the right by pointing and clicking on the option. The option will be highlighted in blue. The example above shows that the Keyword search was selected. The search options are: Keyword search, Title search, Author search, Command Keyword search, Subject heading search, Periodicals search, Subject Word or Phrase search, Call number search.</p>
	
	<p>A Simple Search scans an index and returns every subject, author, title, etc. that begins with the term(s) you type in the dialog box. For example, a search on the subject "medi" would return the topics: medicaid, medical, medici, medicine, medieval and mediterranean. You can search by subject, author, title, periodical title, call number, and so on.</p>
	
	

<h3>Searching Hints</h3>
<ul style="list-style: square;">
	<li> Enter the subject, title, or author name, omitting all punctuation</li>
	<li> Truncation (a stem search) on the right is implied</li>

	<li> When searching by author, enter the last name first</li>

</ul>


<h3>Keyword Searching Hints</h3>
			<p>A Keyword search looks for words located anywhere in a record. For example, a Keyword search on the word "computer" would return all of the titles that contain the word computer anywhere in the record.</p>
			
			<p> To perform a Keyword search:</p>

			
			<ol>
				<li>Type the word(s) you want to search for in the appropriate text box.<br />
Use a question mark (?) after a search term to indicate truncation: comp?<br />
Use quotation marks to search for specific phrases: "world wide web"<br />
Use a plus sign (+) before a term to indicate an essential term: +internet<br />
Use an asterisk (*) before a term to indicate an important term: *explorer<br />
For example: comp? "world wide web" +internet *explorer</li>
				<li>Click the Set Limits icon if you want to limit your keyword search based on other criteria.</li>

				<li>Click on the drop-down menu to select the number of records you want to display on a page.</li>
				<li> Click the Search button to begin your search. Click the Reset button to clear the search page.</li>							
			</ol>
			
<h2><cite>Voyager</cite> Advanced-Search Mode</h2>
<img src="images/advanced.jpg" alt="screen shot of advanced search" style="border: 1px solid #000; margin-bottom: 10px;" />

<p>An Advanced search finds records using keywords located anywhere in a record, or only in specific fields. To perform an Advanced search:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Type in the search term(s) you want to find in the dialog box next to the "Search for" option. (Punctuation, case, and word order are ignored.) Your search terms are automatically truncated at the root level of the word (e.g. comput, educat, institut)</li>
	<li>Default search criteria can be modified for your search:
		<ol type="a">
			<li>Select from the drop-down list whether you want to search for all the search terms, any of the search terms, or the search terms as a phrase.</li>
			<li> Select from the drop-down list next to the Search by option whether you want to search by title, author, subject, and other options.</li>
			<li>Select which Boolean operator you want applied to the next search term(s): AND, OR, or NOT to further limit your search.</li>

		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Click the "Set Limits" icon if you want to limit your search based on other criteria.</li>
</ol>

<p>Click the &quot;Search&quot; button to begin your search. Click the &quot;Reset&quot; button to clear the search page.</p>

<h2><cite>Voyager</cite> Course-Reserve-Search Mode</h2>
<img src="images/reserve.jpg" alt="screen shot of course reserve search" style="border: 1px solid #000; margin-bottom: 10px;" />
<p>A Course-Reserve search allows you to search for items on reserve for various classes. To perform a Course-Reserve search:</p>
<p>Select one item from one (or more) of the following drop-down lists: Instructor, Department, Course, or Section. Note: there is no &quot;Set Limits&quot; option for a course-reserve search.</p>
<p>Click the &quot;Search&quot; button to begin your search. Click the &quot;Reset&quot; button to clear the search page.</p>
