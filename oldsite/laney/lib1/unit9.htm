	<h1>Unit 9: The Internet and the Future of Information</h1>
	
	<h2>Introduction to the Internet</h2>
	
	<p>After completing this module, you will know how to:</p>
	
	<ul class="square">	
		<li>find relevant information on the Internet using search engines and subject directories</li>

		<li>evaluate information found on the Internet</li>			
	</ul>
	<hr />
	
		
	
	
	<h4>Introduction</h4>
	
	<p>The Internet is a network of computers worldwide linked together to exchange information using communication softwares and phone lines. The Internet is a very volatile environment in the sense that new features and capabilities are constantly updated. New sites and new files are created daily and old files disappear almost at the same rate.</p>
	
	<h4>Websites and Web Pages</h4>

	
	<p>These terms are used interchangeably. However, to be more precise, a Web page is one single page of a Web document and can be as long or as short as the author wants it to be. A website, in contrast, is comprised of many Web pages or a single Web page.</p>
	
	<h4>Internet Protocols</h4>
	
	<p>The exchange of information over the Internet is performed using various protocols. They are: e-mail, ftp (file transfer protocol), telnet, http (hypertext transfer protocol), gopher, etc. The most popular protocols are e-mail and hypertext transfer protocol, allowing information exchange via web-based files and thus forming the World Wide Web.</p>
	
	<h4>Free and Fee-based Internet</h4>
	
	<p>Most information on the Internet is free from websites sponsored by government, educational institutions, non-profit institutions, and big corporations selling their products and services. Other information is fee-based and reserved only for paying subscribers with a user ID and password. One example of fee-based service is <cite>ProQuest</cite>, a commercial database accessible via the Internet but reserved only to paying subscribers, such as the LBCC Library and its community of users.</p>

	
	<h4>Browsers</h4>
	
	<p>To read information on the Internet, users must have a software called a browser, installed on their computer. Internet Explorer, Netscape Navagator, and Firefox are examples of browsers. Internet Explorer is the most popular browser. Click on the "<strong>Help</strong>" button to learn how to get the most out of Explorer.</p>
	
	<h4>Uniform Resources Locator (URL)</h4>
	
	<p>Each website has its own Internet address, more properly called Uniform Resource Locator or URL. A URL is composed of the following sequential elements: (1) the protocol, (2) the name of the host computer, (3) the domain or organization's name, (4) the directory name, and (5) the file name. For example:</p>
			<p class="box">http://www.ca.gov/state/portal/myca_homepage.jsp</p>

			
			<p>A URL usually starts, but not always, with www. The top-level domain indicates the nature of the website. For example:</p>

			
			<table summary="This table lists and explains the meaning of top-level domains">
				<tr>
					<th>.edu</th>
					<td>denotes a website sponsored by an educational institution (e.g. ucla.edu).</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>

					<th>.gov</th>
					<td class="example">denotes a website sponsored by a governmental institution (e.g. state.gov).</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>.mil</th>
					<td>denotes a website sponsored by a military institution (e.g. navy.mil).</td>
				</tr>

				<tr>
					<th>.com</th>
					<td>denotes a website sponsored by commercial institution (e.g. disney.com).</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>.org</th>
					<td>denotes a website sponsored by a nonprofit organization (e.g. apa.org).</td>

				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>.net</th>
					<td>denotes a website sponsored by an Internet group (e.g. alaska.net).</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>The URL can tell you a lot about a website. For example:</p>

			
		
			
			<p class="box">http://lib.lbcc.edu/laney/index.htm</p>
			<table summary="This table explains the components of a URL">
				<tr>
					<th>http://</th>
					<td>this site is accessible by hypertext transfer protocol</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>

					<th> lib</th>
					<td> host computer is named "lib," indicating that this is a library site</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>lbcc</th>
					<td>Domain name is lbcc indicating, that this is Long Beach City College</td>

				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>edu</th>
					<td>the site is sponsored by an educational institution</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>laney</th>

					<td>personal account of Dena Laney </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>index.htm</th>
					<td>file name</td>
				</tr>

			<h4>Subject Directories </h4>
			
			<p>A subject directory is a database of Web-based files organized hierarchically by subject matter. Imagine a hierarchy tree beginning on the top with a broad subject or main heading, then organized further into subdivisions of the broad subject. Subject directories are good for browsing when you do not have a specific topic in mind or when you are not sure of the terms or the names to use for your search.</p>
			
			
			<p>There are two types of subject directories:</p>
			
			<ul class="square">
				<li><strong>Commercial subject directories</strong> (e.g. <a title="Yahoo http://www.yahoo.com/" href="http://dir.yahoo.com">Yahoo!</a>, <a title="JoeAnt http://joeant.com/" href="http://joeant.com/"> JoeAnt</a>) have no or very few annotations.</li>

				<li><strong>Academic subject directories</strong> (e.g. <a title="Infomine http://infomine.ucr.edu/" href="http://infomine.ucr.edu/">Infomine</a>, <a title="Librarians' Internet Index" href="http://lii.org/">Librarians' Internet Index</a>) are reviewed by librarians and information specialists; detailed annotations are given with each  website listed.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p class="highlight">The important point to remember is that <strong>directories</strong>, unlike <strong>search engines</strong>, are created and maintained by humans. In order for a website to be listed, the owner must submit the address of the website to the directory's caretakers. The caretakers then evaluate the site, decide whether to include it in the directory, and then assign it an appropriate category within the directory.</p>

			
			
				
			
			<h4>Search Engines</h4>
			
			<p>A <strong>search engine</strong> uses a software program, known as a &quot;<strong>spider,</strong>&quot; &quot;<strong>robot,</strong>&quot; or &quot;<strong>crawler,&quot;</strong> to explore the World Wide Web, assembling information about Web documents, then storing that information in a huge database. This database is made available to the public for searching. Search engines are particularly useful when you have a specific topic in mind, or when you know the terms, keywords, or names to use in your search.</p>

													
			<p>There are two types of search engines:</p>
			
			<ul class="square">
				<li><strong>Single search engines</strong>&#151;<a title="Google http://www.google.com/" href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>, <a title="Yahoo! Search" href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Search</a>, <a title="MSN http://www.msn.com//" href="http://www.msn.com//">MSN</a>, <a title="Ask.com" href="http://www.ask.com/">Ask.com</a> &#151;search only their own in-house compiled database. All  major search engines share some features, but there are some differences in syntax and search features.<br/>

					<br/>
					Currently, <a title="Google" href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> is the most popular search engine, but it is important to remember that there are other excellent search engines, some of which go beyond the simplicity of Google's inerface and take a fresh approach to searching. For example, once you have entered a search and obtained your results list in <a title="Ask.com" href="http://www.ask.com/">Ask.com</a>, which is based upon the technology developed by the Teoma search engine, you are provided with a list of related terms that will help you to narrow or expand your search. This feature assists you to refine your search in order to retrieve more precise results. <br/>

					<br/>The content indexed in the various search engines may overlap; however, you will probably find content contained in one engine that may not be indexed by another. Because of this, it is a good idea to familiarize yourself with various search engines; sometimes, you may have to use a few search engines to find what you need. <br/>
					<br/>
			  Please note that some services, such as <a title="Yahoo!" href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo!</a> and <a title="Google" href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>, provide both a search engine and a directory.</li>
				<li><strong>Metasearch engines</strong>&#151;e.g. <a title="Viv&iacute;simo http://clusty.com/" href="http://clusty.com/">Clusty</a>, <a title="Ixquick http://ixquick.com/" href="http://ixquick.com/">Ixquick</a>, <a title="Dogpile" href="http://dogpile.com/">Dogpile</a>&#151;simultaneously search several different search engines. </li>

			</ul>
			
			<p><span class="highlight">The important thing to remember about search engines is that they list all the sites they find, without the benefit of human intervention or evaluation.</span> Even though some search engines use sophisticated search algorithms that &quot;think,&quot; the net result is, however, an immense database that probably contains some clutter.</p>
			
			
			<p>The Post-Google Expanding Web</p>
			
			<p>As the World Wide Web continues to expand and evolve, there is an emerging trend toward the building of &quot;virtual communities.&quot; A virtual community, as defined by <a title="Wikipedia.org" href="http://wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>, is a &quot;group of people communicating or interacting with each other by means of information technologies, typically the Internet, rather than face to face. Virtual communities are also known as online communities or mediated communities.&quot; Virtual communities allow people to share information.</p>
			
			<p>Following is a list of "post-Google" technologies: </p>
			
			<ul class="square">
			
				<li>Blogs and RSS feeds</li>

				<li>Tags</li>
				<li>Wikis</li>
				<li>Media searches</li>
				<li>Personalized spaces and services</li>													
			</ul>
			<p>If you would like to learn more about these technologies, attend one of the Library's workshops.</p>

			<h4>Evaluation of Internet Resources</h4>
			
			<p>Internet resources are subject to the same evaluation criteria as for printed resources:</p>
			
			<ul style="list-style: square;">
				<li>Currency </li>
				<li>Author </li>

				<li>Publisher </li>
				<li>Depth </li>
				<li>Bias</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>It is more difficult to evaluate Internet resources because often the author's name is not so obvious to see. Some Web sites do not give out information such as publication date or when the Web site was last updated. When you visit a Web site, look for the update date generally found at the bottom of the page. The sponsoring institution of the Web site would give a good indication about the credibility or authority of the site. You need to determine who is the target audience for the site in question. Measure the depth of information given out from this site. Look for bias: does the site aims to inform, or to educate, or to proselytize, or to publish its propaganda? Check the links included in this site; too many dead links would indicate that this is a static Web site and the information it contains may not be current.</p>
