	<p>After completing this module, you will know how to:</p>
	
	<ul class="square">			
		<li>utilize a research guide for your specific research topic</li>
		<li>locate research guides/subject guides/pathfinders on the LBCC website</li>	
		<li>create your own research guide</li>				
	</ul> 
	<hr />	
	<h3>Research Guide/Subject Guide/Pathfinder</h3>
	<p>Your final project in this course is to create a research guide for your specific research topic. What is a research guide and how do you use one?</p>
	<p>A research guide, also called subject guides or pathfinders, is a list of resources compiled for a specific subject/topic area. Usually the guides consist of information of keywords or subject headings recommended as terms to search for in online catalogs or research databases. Additionally you will generally find a list of call number ranges to look for in the library.</p>
	<p>General overviews of the topic provided by subject specific reference books are highlighted, as well as specific books (or e-books) that are recommended.</p>
	<p>Other areas discussed are how to search research databases, which specific periodicals are recommended for the topic, and finally websites of particular interest.</p>	
	<p>The intended audience for a research guide is the student (or researcher). Your assignment will be written for this intended audience as well.</p>
	<h3>Research Guides at the LBCC library</h3>
	<p>Included on the LBCC library website is a list of subject specific guides (research guides) that have been compiled by librarians. You can access these subject guides by going to the Library homepage, looking under the Library Services section and clicking on Subject Guides. Visit the list of subject guides and notice the various formats. Some are very extensive while others provide a general overview.</p>
	<h3>Purpose of Research Guides</h3>
	<p>Research Guides act a map which students can use that directs them to specific resources about their research topic.</p>
	<h3>Your Research Guide</h3>
	<p>Take this time to read and review the instructions for the final project. Post any questions/comments in the general discussion forum.</p>
