	<h3>Evaluating Information</h3>
<p>Living in an age characterized by information overload, users need to exercise skill and care when evaluating information. They need to understand how content is structured in order to use it effectively. Ultimately, the responsibility for determining whether or not a particular piece of information is relevant to the assigned research topic rests with the individual researcher.</p>
<h4>The publication cycle or dissemination of information</h4>
<ol>
	<li>In the first stage, information is disseminated from primary sources created by an individual (e.g. Marie Curie's lab notes, Leonardo da Vinci's manuscripts, Vincent Van Gogh's letters to his brother Theo, oral histories)</li>
	<li>In the second stage, information is disseminated from secondary sources created by individuals who review, summarize, and criticize the original works of the primary sources (e.g. review articles, abstracts, and indexes).</li>
	<li>In the third stage, information is disseminated from tertiary sources that summarize and synthesize popularly accepted primary and secondary sources.</li>
</ol>
<p>An analysis of such factors as author, publisher, currency, and review provides insight into the value of information to a particular research topic.</p>
<h4>Author</h4>
<p>A piece of creative work&#151;be it a painting, a concerto, or a book&#151;is defined by its creator or author. In the publishing field more so than any other creative field, such as music and the fine arts, the author is the primary factor to consider when evaluating a work. Information is evaluated based on its reliability and credibility; hence, the author's authority is of utmost importance. Questions to consider are: Is the author an expert in the field he/she is addressing? Does the author have an impartial stance? How is the author viewed by his/her peers?</p>
<p>The publishing track record of authors is one good indication of their authority on a particular subject. The library's online catalog, <cite>Voyager</cite>, or <cite>Books in Print</cite> (author series) provides information about an author's body of work.</p>
<p>When experts working in the same field cite an author's work, this is a good indication of the author's authority. However, not all citations are positive; some citations may be negative, fueling a dynamic debate among thinkers. In such circumstances, users must rely on their personal judgment when evaluating authors.</p>
<h4>Publisher</h4>
<p>The publisher is often overlooked in the evaluation of information. A publisher's name and reputation should be a criterion for evaluating information.</p>
<p>When evaluating books, a university publisher (for example, UCLA Press, Princeton Press) denotes a scholarly publication, most likely the product of years of research. Certain publishers earn a reputation for publishing in a particular field or in a particular language. McGraw Hill, for example, is known as a publisher of educational materials. Arte Publico Press is known for publishing books in Spanish, as well as books related to Latino culture.</p>
<p>When evaluating periodical articles, the title of the periodical is the most important factor, unless the author of an article is well-known. For example, <cite>The New York Times</cite> is widely regarded as a leading newspaper. In scholarly journals, articles are written by professors or research scientists with avant-garde ideas and theories on a particular subject. Frequently, instructors in higher education require students to use sources from scholarly, peer-reviewed journals.</p>
<p>A comparison between popular magazines and scholarly journals is discussed at:<p><a title="Comparion of magazines and journals" href="http://www.library.cornell.edu/okuref/research/skill20.html">http://www.library.cornell.edu/okuref/research/skill20.html</a></p>
<h4>Date of publication</h4>
<p>Although the date of publication indicates the currency of a work, in reality, most books or articles are written long before they are actually published, due to the lengthy publishing process. Citations to a book or an article should always provide the date of publication.</p>
<p>In dynamic fields, such as business, science, and technology, where new information is created  daily, currency is essential, because information can become obsolete in a relatively short amount of time. Pay particular attention with hot social issues that the date of the publication corresponds to the issue. </p>
<p>Currency is not a decisive factor in works considered to be classics, because such works are perenially referred to and cited by present-day writers. In the field of library science, for example, Pierce Butler's <cite>Introduction to Library 
Science</cite>, published in 1933, is a must-read for students of library science. Works by Socrates and Plato are frequently quoted by today's thinkers. </p>
<h3>Bias/Purpose</h3>
<p>On the Internet or in viewpoint essays it is important that you evaluate and understand the potential bias of a resource. If a website, investigate the organization or author for purpose. Some websites can be funded by an organization with a mission to promote an idea or side of an issue or to promote a product. Viewpoint essays are opinion pieces and should be considered opinions rather than factual evidence. Be sure to comprehend both sides of an issue when researching or writing about a topic. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Coverage</h3>
<p>When choosing a resource consider the coverage of the resource in the topic area that you are researching. If you are looking for an overview of a topic, try to keep your search process focused on overview resources rather than a resource that might just discuss a specific area of your topic.</p>
<p>You can learn more about evaluating information at:</p>

<h3>Citing Information</h3>
<p>The research process is dependent upon gathering information sources in support of your thesis statement. At the end of your research paper, you need to properly list the sources that you have consulted. The description of a consulted source is referred to as a citation, because it cites a particular item, such as a document, a book, a periodical article, a film, etc., which informs your research paper. A group of citations is called a selective bibliography, or preferably, a sources-consulted list, because a true bibliography would include all the documents ever written on a particular subject.</p>
<p>There are standard formats for citing sources. Specific elements (author's name, title, date of publication, etc.) must be included in the citation, and the elements may vary according to the item being cited.</p>
<p>The two most popular handbooks for writing standard citations are the MLA (Modern Language Association) handbook and the APA (American Psychological Association) handbook. Instructors are very strict about insisting on properly formatted citations. I highly recommend that you refer often to, and become adept at, using either handbook. While most libraries have these handbooks in their collections, purchasing a personal copy is an excellent investment in your education.</p>
<p>For this class, we will use the <cite>MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers</cite>, 5th edition, by Joseph Gibaldi. Look at the index in the back of the book and find the sections dealing with citing books, periodicals, electronic sources, and other information formats. The specific sections are too numerous to list here. Here are a few of the most-referred-to sections:</p>
	<ul class="square">
		<li>Section 4.6. for instructions on citing books and other nonperiodical publications.</li>
		<li>Section 4.7. for instructions on citing articles and other publications in periodicals.</li> 
		<li>Section 4.8.1 for instructions on citing a television or radio program.</li>
		<li>Section 4.8.2 for instructions on citing a sound recording.</li>
		<li>Section 4.8.3 for instructions on citing a film or video recording.</li>
		<li>Section 4.9. for instructions on citing electronic publications.</li>	
	</ul>

<p>The following examples illustrate basic rules of citation according to MLA style:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Author's full name (last name first)</li>
