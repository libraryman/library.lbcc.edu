              versions of court cases and laws. The distinction is made based 
              on what agency publishes the case or law. The &quot;official&quot; 
              versions are those published by the U.S. government Printing Office 
              in Washington, D.C. The &quot;unofficial&quot; versions are those 
              published by private publishing companies such as the West Publishing 
              Company. These contain the exact text and are just as authoritative 
              as the official versions. They also have two major advantages. First, 
              they are annotated with additional information. Second, they are 
              published a lot faster than the official versions. Please note that 
              not all court decisions are published. Those that are published 
              are discussed below. </font></font></td>

          - These are similar to the U.S. Reports but are published by the West 
          Publishing Company. Supreme Court Reporter is an unofficial version 
          of Supreme Court opinions or decisions. It publishes the Court's decisions 
          with page references to the official United States Reports, as well 
          as other editorial enhancements, including headnotes. Corresponding 
          U.S. Reports volume and page numbers are printed on the spine of the 
          Supreme Court Reporter. <br>
          The citation, S.Ct. is substituted for U.S. in above example. The citation 
          for the Rosenberg case is 73 S.Ct. 1152, which means volume 73 of the 
          Supreme Court Reporter, page 1152.</font></p>

          Although LBCC does not own the U.S. Reports, it is included in this 
          handout to illustrate how a statutory or case law is cross-referenced 
          in legal publications (also called parallel citations). For example, 
          the case, Employee Drug Testing Case is cited in Shepard's Acts and 
          Cases by Popular Names as being available in three sources:</font></p>
