                the true story of the last days of a wise college professor. When 
                Mitch Albom, a successful reporter, finds his former mentor dying 
                of a devastating disease, he returns once again to meet each Tuesday 
                as in college. Mitch visits with his professor, Morrie Schwartz, 
                on these precious Tuesdays to discuss the important things in 
                life as they did twenty years earlier. The result is a touching, 
                thought-provoking journey through the philosophy of life, death 
                and the search for meaning. Below are a few thoughts from the 
                book (<a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/resources/bookgroup/tuesdaysmorrie_bgc.html" target="_blank" class="greennoline">Doubleday

                meaningful life will not be found in the next job or the next 
                car. The way you get meaning in your life is to devote yourself 
                to helping others and creating something that gives you purpose.<br>

                Am I ready? Am I doing all I need to do?&nbsp; Am I being the

                this culture it's so important to find a loving relationship with 
                someone because so much of the culture does not give you that.&nbsp; 
                But the poor kids today, either they're too selfish to take part 
                in a real loving relationship, or they rush into marriage and 
                then six months later, they get divorced.&nbsp; They don't know 
                what they want in a partner.&nbsp; They don't know who they are 
                themselves--so how can they know who they're marrying?</font></li>

                  many people walk around with a meaningless life. They seem half-asleep, 
                  even when they are busy doing things they think are important.&nbsp; 
                  This is because they are chasing the wrong things. The way you 
                  get meaning into your life is to devote yourself to loving others, 
                  devote yourself to your community around you, and devote yourself 
                  to creating something that gives you purpose and meaning.<br>
