          Abstract</b> - <i>resumen / analyse / Referat</i> --This word is used 
          three ways. (1) A short summary of an <b>ARTICLE</b> in a scholarly 
          <b>JOURNAL</b>. It usually appears at the beginning of the article. 
          (2) An <b>INDEX</b> to journal articles that not only provides a <b>CITATION</b> 
          to the articles, but also gives a brief summary of each article. (3) 
          A summary of a paper presented at a conference. The full text of the 
          paper is not always published.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Article </b>- <i>art&Igrave;culo / Artikel </i>-- A (brief) essay 
          or research report on a subject. Articles can appear in <b>MAGAZINE</b>s, 
          <b>JOURNAL</b>s, newspapers, or other sources such as encyclopedias.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Audiovisual</b> - <i>audiovisual / audioviseull</i> -- Information 
          in a form other than words printed on paper. Examples include films, 
          slides, audio tapes, videocassettes, phonograph records, music CDs, 
          and computer software.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Author</b> - <i>aut&Ucirc;r / auteur / Autor</i> -- The writer of 
          a book or <b>ARTICLE</b>. Usually this is a person (or perhaps two or 
          three people), but it can also be a government agency, a symposium, 
          a company, or other group that does not necessarily give the name(s) 
          of the people who actually wrote the work.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Bar code</b> - <i>c&Ucirc;digo numerico / code a batonnets / Strichleincode</i>

          publication that consists only of a list of books, <b>ARTICLE</b>s and 
          other works on a particular topic. Sometimes bibliographies are annotated, 
          that is, they include brief <b>ABSTRACT</b>s summarizing the important 
          features of the<br>
          works. Bibliographies of both types can be very valuable in locating 
          information on a subject.<br>

          <b>Books</b> - <i>los libros / des livres</i> -- According to <i>AACR2r</i>,

          one part or complete, or intended to be completed, in a finite number 
          of separate parts). There are two categories of availability of books 
          in any library: those you can take/check out and those you cannot take/check 
          out of the library. The books that you <b>can check out</b> of the library 
          are called <b>circulating</b> books. These are filed by subject on the 
          circulating shelves. The books that you <b>cannot</b> <b>check out</b> 
          of the library are called <b>reference books</b> and are also shelved 
          by subject in the reference room or at the reference desk. There are 
          some books that are placed on <b>RESERVE </b>by professors that may 
          not be checked out of the library.<br>

          clasificacion / cote de placement / Standnummer</i> -- The number given 
          to each book acquired by a library. Every book has a unique call number, 
          much like every house in a city has its own address. The first portion 
          of the call number (one or two letters) is like the name of the city. 
          The second line (a whole numeral) is like the street the third line 
          (following the period) is like the building's street address, and the 
          last portion is like the &igrave;apartment number. The call number is 
          printed on a white label and placed on the spine or cover of a book. 
          These are examples of call numbers:<br>

          name. Reserve materials can be looked up by the professor's last name 
          or course number, at any on-line catalog terminals. Due to high use, 
          <b>LOAN PERIOD</b>s for reserve materials are very short, usually for 
          an hour or two or overnight.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Serial</b> - <i>revista / p&Egrave;riodique / Zeitschrift</i> -- 
          Publications that are issued in successive parts, usually at regular 
          intervals. Examples include <b>PERIODICAL</b>s, <b>JOURNAL</b>s, <b>MAGAZINE</b>s, 
          newspapers, annual reports, series, some conference proceedings, and 
          annual reviews.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Series</b><i>-</i>- <i>AACR2r</i> defines series as: a group of separate 
          items related to one another by the fact that each item bears, in addition 
          to its own title proper, a collective title applying to the group as 
          a whole. <b><i>At Issue, Contemporary World Issues, </i></b>and<b><i> 
          Opposing Viewpoints</i></b> are examples of series titles. Each book 
          in these series has its own title, but they all have one unique title 
          that unifies all of them.<br>
          <br>
          <a href="../../../../libweb/libweb/web-content/Handouts/callnum.htm"><b>Stacks</b> </a>- <i>estantes de acceso libre 
          / rayons a libre acces / Selbstbeienungsstellungen</i> -- The shelves 
          that hold the library's books. <i>Note</i>: At LBCC, as in most American 
          libraries, the stacks are "open", that is, you may get books directly 
          from the stacks. You do not need to ask a librarian to get the books 
          for you, although the librarian can help you identify the books you 
          want in the on-line catalog database.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Subject Headings</b> - <i>encabezamientos de materias / systeme des 
          vedette-matieres / uberschrift oder Schlagwort</i> -- Terms used to 
          divide knowledge into related subject areas, which correspond to locations 
          shown by <b>CALL NUMBERS</b>.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Volumes </b>- <i>volumenes / Datentrageren</i> -- Library materials 
          that are part of a single title but appear as separate bound items. 
          Individual issues of a <b>PERIODICAL</b> that are bound together into 
          a single book are often called a volume. (Usually, this equals one year 
          of that periodical.) Also, large books are sometimes divided into two 
          or more volumes (like encyclopedias).<br>
          <br>
