<I>SIRS (Social Issues Resources Series</I>, not available at
LBCC Library), their indexes list topics alphabetically; you may
also try electronic databases such as LBCC Library online catalog,
<I>Proquest Direct</I> for subject headings and subheadings to
help you narrow down your topic. The <I>Library of Congress Subject

topics. To find synonyms, consult a thesaurus, which is a book
or an online database listing words and their synonyms. Online
