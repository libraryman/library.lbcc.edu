<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The purpose of this assignment is to give
you further hands-on practices with different Web-based databases
and their search features. Remember that most databases provide
direct e-mail service (i.e., you can e-mail the result of your
searches directly to your e-mail account). For this assignment,
you may need to do some editing first, then e-mail the results
to me either as a message or as an attachment to your e-mail message.</FONT></P>
