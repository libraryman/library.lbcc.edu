<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Using the topic that you have decided upon
in module three, search Voyager or another library catalog. Select
three documents from the results list (they can be all books or
a combination of books, videos, pamphlets, etc.) that you think
most likely to provide the information you need and explain why
you selected them. The bibliographic record will give sufficient
information about each document for you to answer the questions.
However, it is best that you come in the library and examine the
documents yourself. For each document selected, give detailed
description of the document and its appropriateness for your topic.
Factors that weight in your decision should include:</FONT></P>

<UL>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">What do you know about the author? Is
  he a specialist in the field and has written many books? (The
  catalog will provide links to the author's other books owned
  by the library, a good indication of the author's authority.
  <I>Books in Print</I>, <I>Book Review Digest</I>, <I>Contemporary
  Authors</I> are excellent sources to learn about an author's
  body of works; search under the author's last name. )</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">What does the subject content of the book
  tell you about its relevancy for your topic?</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Can you tell about a book content by its
  title?</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Is the publisher a respected and well-known
  publishing house? (Again, search the library catalog to find
  out how many books by this publisher currently in the library
  collection. Does the publisher produce many books on a certain
  subject?)</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Is currency important with this topic
  and why is it so?</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Does the document provide a serious information
  or is it propaganda with an agenda? (Oftentimes, the cover or
  the book jacket give good indication of the nature of a book).</FONT>
</UL>

<P><B><U><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">Part II. Periodicals</FONT></U></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">You will make comparisons between a popular
magazine and a scholarly journal. You may use either print or
electronic version of the periodical. For some periodicals, LBCC
Library subscribes to them in both print and electronic formats.<BR>
The main purpose of this assignment is to compare the contents
(type, length, and quality of articles) and the presentation (type
and quality of graphics, advertisements) of the two different
types of periodicals.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Select one scholarly journal and one popular
magazine of your choice.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">A.</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"> For
the print version, leaf through the whole issue of each periodical
and briefly scan through the articles in both periodicals.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">B.</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"> For
electronic version, log on to <I>ProQuest Direct</I> and perform
a publication search. After logging-in, click on Continue; this
will bring you to the next screen where you see the <B>New Search</B>
feature with three selections: <B>by word</B>, <B>for publication</B>,
<B>by topic</B>. Click on for publication, then type in the dialog
box the name of the publication you have chosen or you may also
select from the alphabetical list of publications provided by
<I>ProQuest Direct </I>by clicking on <B>List publications</B>.
Scroll down the list and click on the names of two periodicals
of your choice, making sure to select one scholarly and one popular
publication. This will take you the screen with a list of issues
available sorted by date, the most current one being listed first.
Click on the most current issue and briefly look at a few articles
to determine the type and size of the articles.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">C</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">. Make
comparisons by listing characteristics of each periodical. You
may create two separate columns, one for each periodical, or you
may write a paragraph for each periodical. Whatever format you
chose, answer the following questions about each periodical:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">1. Is information such as expertise and
qualifications of the article's author included?<BR>
2. What is the nature and the length of most articles?<BR>
3. Are there advertisements? What kind and how many?<BR>
4. Is there a bibliography at the end of each article?<BR>
