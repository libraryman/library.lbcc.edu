<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In the information overload age, users need
to put to the test any piece of information coming their way.
Users need to understand how the content of information sources
is structured in order to use these sources effectively. In the
end, only the individual user can determine whether or not the
information is relevant to the assigned research.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">The publication cycle or dissemination
of information</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Information is disseminated in three stages:<BR>
1. In the first stage, information is disseminated from primary
sources created by an individual (e.g. Marie Curie's lab notes,
Leonardo da Vinci's manuscripts, Vincent Van Gogh's letters to
his brother Theo, oral histories)<BR>
2. In the second stage, information is disseminated from secondary
sources created by individuals who review, summarizes, and criticizes
the original works of the primary sources (e.g. review articles,
abstracts and indexes)<BR>
3. In the third stage, information is disseminated from tertiary
sources which summarize and synthesize popularly accepted primary
and secondary sources.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">There are specific criteria such as author,
publisher, currency, and review that guide users to evaluate sources
of information.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Author</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">A piece of creative work, be it a painting,
a concerto, or a book is defined by its creator or author. In
the publishing field, much more than in other creative fields
such as music and fine arts, the author is the primary factor
to consider when evaluating the work. Information deals with reliability
and credibility, hence the author's authority is of utmost importance.
Is the author an expert in the pertaining field? Does the author
have an impartial stance? How is the author viewed by the peers
in the field?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Refer to our lesson on Biographical Reference
Sources to find information about authors.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The author's publishing track record is
one good indication of the author's authority on a particular
subject. The library online catalog or the BOOKS IN PRINT (author
series) will provide information about an author's body of works.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Citations of the author's works by other
experts in the field are indications of the author's authority.
However, not all citations are positive, some citations may be
negative, and this is all part of the dynamic debate among thinkers.
The user relies on his/her personal judgment when evaluating authors.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Publisher</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Publisher's name is often overlooked in
the evaluation of information. Publisher's name should be one
of the criteria for evaluating information.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">When evaluating books, a university publisher's
name on the cover (UCLA Press, Princeton Press, etc.) indicates
that they are scholarly publications, the results of years of
research. Many publishers are well-known for specific subject
or language areas because that is all they publish (e.g. McGraw
Hill for educational materials, Arte Publico Press for Spanish
subjects and in Spanish).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">When evaluating periodical articles, the
name of the periodical (e.g. the New York Time is a respected
newspaper) is the most important factor, unless the article's
author is well-known. In scholarly journals, articles are written
by professors or research scientists with avant-garde ideas and
theories on a particular subject. For class assignments, teachers
usually prefer or demand that students use sources from scholarly
journals.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Comparison between popular magazines and
scholarly journals is discussed at:<BR>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Date of publication</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Although date is an indication of currency,
most books or articles were written long before they were actually
published due to the lengthy publishing process. Citations to
a book or an article always give the date of publication.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The date of publication indicates the currency
of the information. In the volatile fields of business, science
and technology, currency is essential because information can
become ancient in a relatively short time.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Currency does not apply in many works considered
classic masterpieces because they are often referred to and cited
by modern experts. In the field of Library Science, Pierce Butler's
<I>Introduction to Library Science,</I> published in 1933, is
a must-read for library science students. Works by Socrates and
Plato are often quoted by modern thinkers. (Do you know when they
wrote their masterpieces?)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Currency does not apply to sources of information
that were published pertaining to and concurrently to an event.
Currency is irrelevant with regard to both primary sources (i.e.
Marie Curie's laboratory notes in Paris when she was conducting
radium experiments) and secondary sources (i.e. newspaper accounts
of Marie Curie's experiments with radium).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The research process involves gathering
information sources to support your thesis statements. At the
end of your research paper, you need to correctly describe the
sources that you have consulted. The description of each source
consulted is called a citation because it cites a document (a
book, periodical article, film, etc.) that you have used to write
your research paper. The group of citations that you list is called
a selective bibliography or preferably a sources-consulted list,
because a true bibliography would include all the documents ever
written on a particular subject.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">There are specific ways and orders to cite
information sources, depending on the type and the format of the
source. There are specific elements (author's name, title, date
of publication, etc.) that must be included in the citation, and
again, the elements vary according to the item being cited.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The two most popular handbooks for writing
proper citations are the MLA (Modern Language Association) handbook
and the APA (American Psychology Association) handbook. Teachers
are very strict about proper citations, I highly recommend that
you refer often to and become adept at using either handbook.
Most libraries have these handbooks in their collection, however,
the purchase of one of these books is a good investment for future
uses.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">For this class, we will use the <I>MLA Handbook
for Writers of Research Papers</I>, 5th edition, by Joseph Gibaldi.
Look in the index in the back of the book, find the proper section
to consult for citing books, periodicals, electronic sources,
etc. The specific sections are too numerous to list them all here.
These are a few sections most referred to:</FONT></P>

<UL>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Section 4.6. for instructions on citing
  books and others nonperiodical publications.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Section 4.7. for instructions on citing
  articles and other publications in periodicals.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Section 4.8.1 for instructions on citing
  a television or radio program.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Section 4.8.2 for instructions on citing
  a sound recording.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Section 4.8.3 for instructions on citing
  a film or video recording.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Section 4.9. for instructions on citing
  electronic publications.</FONT>
