<P><FONT FACE="Arial">An index is a pointer to a piece of information
in periodicals or in books. An index does not contain the information
itself. An index is arranged in a certain order designed to guide
users to the needed piece of information, be it an article in
a periodical or a chapter in a book. The goal of indexes is to
guide users to the intellectual content and the physical location
of documents.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">There are two types of indexes:</FONT></P>

<UL>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Book indexes</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Periodical indexes</FONT>
</UL>

<P><CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#000099" FACE="Arial">Book indexes</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">A book index provides a pointer
to the information included in the book; a book index is arranged
alphabetically, gives a page location, and is usually found at
the back of the book. Example of a book index such as a travel
book would include place names, historical events or historical
sites, hotels, and resorts. Example of a book index such as a
cook book would include ingredient names, recipes, measurements
and culinary activities.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Before going further, you should first become
familiar with the following terms:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">A periodical is a publication with a fixed
interval between issues or numbers, such as weekly, monthly, or
quarterly. Examples of periodicals are <I>Newsweek, Business Week,
and National Review.</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">A journal is a publication dealing with
a specialized subject, containing articles written by experts
in the field. Journals tend to be scholarly in nature and research-oriented,
where the result of primary research is reported. The articles
published in journals frequently have abstracts &shy;i.e., summaries-
and bibliographies. Examples of journals are <I>American Journal
of Psychology </I>and<I> Journal of the American Medical Association.</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">A magazine is a popular publication of general
interest, which is usually written in non-technical terms and
frequently has illustrations. Examples are <I>National Geographic
and Sports Illustrated. <BR>
</I><BR>
Refer to Module 4 on evaluating information to distinguish between
a popular magazine and a scholarly journal.</FONT></P>

<P><CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#000099" FACE="Arial">Periodical indexes</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">Periodical indexes are much different
than book index. A book generally is written by one author on
a specific topic with a single focus from the beginning to the
end. In contrast, a periodical is open-ended, with contributions
by different authors using different styles writing on different
subjects. From this sea of information, indexes must create some
order and provide a clear and standardized arrangement to guide
users to the right document. There are two types of periodical
indexes:</FONT></P>

<UL>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Individual indexes</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Broad indexes</FONT>
</UL>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">An individual index would only index for
a specific periodical, for example: <I>National Geographic Index</I>
would cover only articles from <I>National Geographic</I> magazine,
<I>Los Angeles Times Index </I>would cover only articles from
the<I> Los Angeles Times.</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Broad indexes would index articles from
thousands of periodicals. There are general broad indexes (e.g.
<I>Readers' Guide to Periodical Literature)</I>, and discipline-specific
broad indexes (e.g. <I>Business Periodicals Index</I>).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Periodical indexes are published in various
formats: print, microforms, CD-ROM, online. In this LIB 1 course,
we will concentrate on printed and online periodical indexes.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Print periodical indexes</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Liberal Arts Campus Library subscribes
to several print periodical indexes, which are published by the
H.W.Wilson Company. Print indexes are updated monthly and sent
to libraries in soft cover editions. At the end of a twelve-month
period, they are bound in an annual volume with the corresponding
year clearly marked on the spine.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Print indexes are arranged alphabetically
by author and subject headings with subdivisions. Users will search
under headings to locate relevant periodical articles; each article
listing is called a citation. One main disadvantage of using print
indexes is that users still need to go to the periodical shelves
and look for the article in the correct periodical, which sometimes
is not available due to loss or being checked out. The main advantage
with print indexes is that users can search for retrospective
information published many decades ago. For example, the <I>New
York Times Index</I> goes as far back as 1851.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Some of print indexes available at LAC library:</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Art Index<BR>
Business Periodicals Index<BR>
Education Index<BR>
Social Sciences Index<BR>
Humanities Index</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Since the form, arrangement, and frequency
of these indexes are similar, only one index will be described
in detail below:</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Readers' Guide to Periodical Literature</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This index covers approximately 190 general-interest
periodicals, such as <I>Time, Ebony</I>, <I>Scientific American,
</I>and<I> People Weekly</I>. The arrangement is by specific subjects
in one alphabet. There are many cross references. Under the subject,
each entry lists articles by title, author, name of the periodical
(in italics and usually abbreviated). volume, pages, and date.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Electronic periodical indexes</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Electronic indexes are updated almost daily
and offer choices of searches not available in print indexes.
Users can choose unstructured keyword search, or publication search,
or a structured advanced search within specific date range. Electronic
indexes offer a one-stop-shop experience in that users obtain
not only citations, but also abstracts and full-text of articles
with printing, downloading, and e-mailing capabilities. The main
disadvantage with electronic indexes is that most of their databases
begin from 1986 only. So, if users want to find retrospective
periodical articles published before 1986, they have to use print
indexes. In Module 8, we will explore some of the electronic indexes
subscribed by LBCC Library as follow:</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial">ProQuest Direct </FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial">(with
more than ten discipline-specific databases)<BR>
<I>InfoTrac Web<BR>
Newsbank</I></FONT></P>

<P><CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#000099" FACE="Arial">Specialized indexes</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Granger's Index to Poetry</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This index has been around for a long time,
and it will help you locate poems in collections. Each volume
is organized in the same way, comprised of several sections. In
the back of the volume, there is a subject index and an author
index. The major section is a title and first line index in one
alphabet. Each entry lists the anthologies in which the poem appears.
All of the books indexed are listed in the front of the volume.
If an anthology is available at the Liberal Arts Campus Library,
the call number is pencilled in next to the title.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Short Story Index</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">These volumes index short stories in collections.
The main section lists short story titles, authors, and subjects
in one alphabet. The author entries list every short story by
that author and the anthology where each one can be found. The
anthologies are listed in the back of each volume. If the anthology
is available in the Liberal Arts Campus Library, the call number
is written next to the title entry.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Essay and General Literature Index</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Every year, essays are published in collections
on many subjects. This index lists these essays by authors, about
authors, and about individual works of authors. In addition, it
indexes essays by subject. Each entry lists the author of the
essay and its title, lists the books it is in, as well as the
page numbers. The books indexed are listed in the back and those
owned by LBCC Library have the call number written by the title.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Play Index</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Play index</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial">
is published every five year. It indexes plays that were published
during a given five-year period. Plays which were omitted from
the previous volume would be included in the current volume. In
the word of the publisher, each volume &quot;contains both separately
published plays and plays in collections, written in or translated
into English. Its broad scope &shy; from puppet plays to classical
drama &shy; and detailed cast analysis make <I>Play Index</I>
suitable for a variety of uses.&quot; It is a combined title,
author, and subject index arranged alphabetically.</FONT></P>
