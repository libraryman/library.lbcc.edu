<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Internet is a network of computers worldwide
linked together to exchange information using communication softwares
and phone lines. The Internet is a very volatile environment in
the sense that new features and capabilities are constantly updated.
New sites and new files are created daily and old files disappear
almost at the same rate.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Web sites and Web pages<BR>
</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">These terms are used interchangeably.
However, to be more precise, a Web page is one single page of
a Web document and can be as long or as short as the author wants
it to be. A Web site is comprised of many Web pages or a single
Web page.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Internet protocols<BR>
</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">The exchange of information over
the Internet is performed using various protocols. They are: e-mail,
ftp (file transfer protocol), telnet, http (hypertext transfer
protocol), gopher, etc. The most popular protocols are e-mail
and hypertext transfer protocol allowing information exchange
via web-based files and thus forming the World Wide Web.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Free and Fee-based Internet<BR>
</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">Most information on the Internet
is free from Web sites sponsored by governmental, educational,
non-profit institutions, and big corporations selling their products
and services. Other information is fee-based and reserved only
for paying subscribers with users ID and passwords. One example
of fee-based service is ProQuest Direct, a commercial database
accessible via the Internet but reserved only to paying subscribers
such as LBCC Library and its campus users.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Browsers<BR>
</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">To read information on the Internet,
users must have a software called browser such as Internet Explorer
or Netscape installed on their computers. Netscape is the most
popular browser, to learn more about getting the most out of Netscape,
go to:<BR>
<A HREF="http://help.netscape.com/products/client/communicator/IntroComm/Introcom.html"
TARGET="_blank">http://help.netscape.com/products/client/communicator/IntroComm/Introcom.html</A><BR>
If you have Internet Explorer on your computer, look for the Help
button on the screen to learn more about it.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><A NAME="anchor1339496"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Uniform Resource
Locator (URL)<BR>
</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">Each Web site has its own Internet
address, more properly called Uniform Resource Locator or URL.
A URL is composed of the following sequential elements:<BR>
(1) the protocol, (2) the name of the host computer, (3) the domain
or organization's name, (4) the directory name, and (4) the file
name. For example:</FONT></P>

<DL>
  <DD><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
  http://www.governor.ca.gov/gray/index.shtm<BR>
  </FONT>
</DL>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">A URL usually starts, but not always, with
www.<BR>
The top level domain indicates the nature of the Web site:</FONT></P>

<DL>
  <DD><B><FONT FACE="Arial">.edu</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">
  denotes a Web site sponsored by an educational institution (e.g.
  ucla.edu).<BR>
  <B>.gov</B> denotes a Web site sponsored by a governmental institution
  (e.g. state.gov).<BR>
  <B>.mil</B> denotes a Web site sponsored by a military institution
  (e.g. navy.mil).<BR>
  <B>.com</B> denotes a Web site sponsored by commercial institution
  (e.g. disney.com).<BR>
  <B>.org</B> denotes a Web site sponsored by an organization (e.g.
  apa.org).<BR>
  <B>.net</B> denotes a Web site sponsored by an Internet group
  (e.g. alaska.net).</FONT>
</DL>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The URL can tell you much about a web site.

<P><A NAME="anchor1341586"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Subject Directories
<BR>
</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">A subject directory is a database
of Web-based files organized hierarchically by subject matter.
Imagine a hierarchy tree beginning on the top with a broad subject
or main heading, then organized further into subdivisions of the
broad subject. Subject directories are good for browsing when
you do not have a specific topic in mind or when you are not sure
of the terms or the names to use for your search.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">There are two types of subject directories:</FONT></P>

<UL>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Commercial subject directories (e.g. Yahoo,
  etc.) have no or very few annotations and are not evaluated.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Academic subject directories (e.g. Infomine,
  Librarian's Index to the Internet) are reviewed by librarians
  and information specialists; detailed annotations are given with
  each listed Web sites.</FONT>
</UL>

<P><A NAME="anchor1343947"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Search Engines<BR>
</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">A search engine is a database of
Web-based files compiled by a software program. A search engine
has a built-in software to read and respond to users' queries.
Search engines are useful when you have a specific topic in mind,
or when you know the terms or the names to use for your search.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">There are two types of search engines:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
1. <U>Single search engines</U> (e.g. Altavista, Lycos, HotBot,
etc.) search only their own in-house compiled database. Each search
engine has different search syntax and default mode. They all
offer online help service; look for the Help button or Help link
to learn more about each search engine's capabilities. I recommend
that you use the online Help of each search engine to get the
most of what each has to offer. Search engines may overlap each
other with regard to Web sites they include in their database;
however, they also differ greatly from each other. It is a good
idea to familiarize yourself with various search engines; sometimes,
you may have to use a few search engines to find what you need.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
2. <U>Meta search engines</U> (e.g. Metacrawler, etc.) searches
different search engines at the same time.</FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="anchor1347439"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Evaluation
of Internet Resources<BR>
</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">Internet resources are subject to
the same evaluation criteria as for printed resources:</FONT></P>

<UL>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Currency</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Author</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Publisher</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Depth</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Bias</FONT>
</UL>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
It is more difficult to evaluate Internet resources because often
the author's name is not so obvious to see. Some Web sites do
not give out information such as publication date or when the
Web site was last updated. When you visit a Web site, look for
the update date generally found at the bottom of the page. The
sponsoring institution of the Web site would give a good indication
about the credibility or authority of the site. You need to determine
who is the target audience for the site in question. Measure the
depth of information given out from this site. Look for bias:
does the site aims to inform, or to educate, or to proselytize,
or to publish its propaganda? Check the links included in this
site; too many dead links would indicate that this is a static
Web site and the information it contains may not be current.<BR>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">There are four ways to capture electronic
documents:</FONT></P>

<DL>
  <DD><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>

  to name your document.</FONT>
  <DD><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>

  document, go to <B>File</B>, select <B>Send Page</B>, a dialog
  box will prompt you to perform certain tasks, follow the prompts
  in the dialog box. Instructions may vary with a different Web
  browser or with different versions of Netscape. Many commercial
  databases such <I>Proquest Direct</I> and <I>NewsBank</I> have
  built-in e-mail capacity, you need only to click on the e-mail
  button, type in the e-mail address, then click on <B>Send</B>

  <DD><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
  4. <B>Copy and Paste</B> &shy; To copy and paste a whole or a
  portion of an electronic document into a word processing application,
