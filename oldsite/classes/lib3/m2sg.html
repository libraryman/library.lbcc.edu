<P><FONT FACE="Arial">From the time humans first began amassing
a culture's written records into libraries, they have attempted
to arrange records in some reasonable order. With today's massive
collections, classification systems have become quite extensive
and involved. There are two classification systems:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">1. Dewey Decimal Classification<BR>
2. Library of Congress Classification</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Dewey Decimal Classification</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This was, for many years, the most common
classification system used by libraries, and it is still used
by many public and school libraries today.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Dewey developed his system predicated on
the idea that the major areas of knowledge could be divided into
ten major divisions of three-digit numbers (000, 100, 200, etc.
to 900). For example, all of the numbers between 500 and 599 deal
with some aspect of a single subject &shy; pure science. Each
of these divisions is, in turn, divided into ten subdivisions
(510, 520, 530, etc.). Any book, then, with the exception of fiction,
is classified with a number between 001 and 999.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Since greater refinement is often necessary,
a further series of decimal numbers is employed to increase the
distinction in subject matter. At times, the use of decimal numbers
causes difficulty for library users and perpetuates the myth that
there is some mystery that only librarians can fathom in locating
a classified book. However, once students understand the use of
decimals, there is no mystery to the sequence.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Every Dewey number has at least three digits.
They are shelved in a numerical sequence. Thus, 001 precedes 099,
which precedes 100.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Any digits, which follow the first three,
are decimal numbers. Thus, in the classification numbers 910.305
and 910.35, the digits following the decimals (.305 and .35) are
arranged decimally, rather than numerically. Thus:</FONT></P>

<P><CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">910 precedes 910.09, then 910.3,
then 910.305, then 910.35.</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Library of Congress Classification</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Since the Library of Congress utilizes most
of the letters of the alphabet for major divisions, a second letter
for subdivisions, and a series of numbers for further refinement,
the possibilities for expansion are much greater than with the
Dewey Classification system</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Students familiar with the decimal classification
are sometimes confused by the use of letters. Overall, students
tend to find the Library of Congress Classification a simpler
system, once they discover that it, too, is merely a sequence
utilizing letters, as well as numbers.</FONT></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Arial">Accordingly, <B>D precedes DA; DA
precedes DC; DC precedes DD; DD precedes E,</B> etc.</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The numbers which follow the letters in
the Library of Congress Classification (1 through 9999) are shelved
numerically. Thus, the following five books are shelved from left
to right numerically:</FONT></P>

a Library of Congress Classification number. It is, of course,
shelved decimally. Thus:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The <I>Library of Congress Subject Headings</I>
(LCSH) is a set of four big red books, usually shelved in the
Reference collection of most libraries. It is the system established
by the United States Library of Congress, and used by most library
catalogs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The LCSH involves the concept of controlled
vocabulary. In the printed publications environment, when searching
for information from printed indexes or card catalogs, the searcher's
subject terms must match with those of the indexer. For example,
if the searcher uses the term <I>death penalty</I> and gets no
result, it is because the indexer uses the term <I>capital</I>
<I>punishment</I>. Often times, there may be cross-references
leading the searcher to the correct terms to use. Hence, there
must be a system whereby standard subject headings are assigned
to concepts, a sort of common language.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The LCSH was created and it is a controlled
subject heading lists upon which indexers and catalogers refer
to when doing their tasks of indexing and cataloging. It is a
controlled vocabulary environment with predetermined subject headings
which does not always brings results.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The LCSH is updated regularly to reflect
changes in languages and cultures. For example, subject headings
reflecting changes in American life and culture were recently
added: AIDS, Internet, and cyberpunk. <BR>
<BR>
Subject headings are listed in boldface type, e.g., Motorboats,
Agricultural machinery, Drugs. A heading may be followed by the
note (May Subd Geog), indicating that the heading may be subdivided
by geographic locations. Subject headings may consist of one word
or several words. A one-word heading is often a noun, e.g., Motorboats;
two-word headings are usually composed of an adjective and a noun,
e.g. Agricultural machinery.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Subject headings often include some abbreviations
denoting hierarchical relationship between various topics. You
need to become familiar with these abbreviations. Refer to the
introductory chapter at the beginning of the volume to learn how
to interpret the entries. This is a good habit to follow when
using reference sources in the library: to always start first
with the how-to-use section of every reference sources; they all
include an instructional preface or introduction.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Here is one entry example in the <I>Library
of Congress Subject Headings</I>:</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Agricultural machinery</FONT></B><FONT

crops, e.g. Corn - Machinery<BR>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In the example above for the subject heading
Agricultural machinery, we see that it can be subdivided geographically
as indicated by the note (<I>May Subd Geog</I>). Furthermore,
[S671-S760] indicates the class number to use for cataloging books
in this subject. The following abbreviations are read as thus:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
<B>UF </B>indicates that the heading <B>Agricultural machinery
</B>is<B> Used For </B>those listed after<B> UF</B>, i.e.,<B>Agriculture
- Equipment and supplies, Crops - Machinery, Farm machinery<BR>
</B></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">BT </FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">indicates
that the <B>Broader Topic </B>for <B>Agricultural machinery</B>
is<B> Machinery<BR>
</B></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">RT </FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">indicates
that the <B>Related Topic </B>for<B> Agricultural machinery </B>is
<B>Farm equipment, Farm mechanization, </B>and<B> Machine-tractor

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">NT </FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">indicates
that the <B>Narrower Topic </B>for<B> Agricultural machinery </B>is<B>
Agricultural implements, Agricultural instruments</B></FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Let us look at one example of a hierarchical
relationship:<BR>

</B>BT Motor vehicles<BR>
NT Dump trucks<BR>
<B>Dump trucks<BR>
</B>BT Trucks</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The hierarchy tree above provides a clearly
defined organization of the big family tree which is <B>Transportation</B>
into branches, i.e., <B>Vehicles and Motor vehicles</B>, and twigs,
i.e., <B>Trucks and Dump trucks</B>. This example shows that users
could follow the hierarchy from the narrowest topic <B>Dump trucks</B>
to the broadest topic <B>Transportation.</B></FONT></P>
