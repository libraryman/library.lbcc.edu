<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Units of an electronic database</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">All electronic databases, whether online
catalogs, Web search engines, or CD-ROM indexes are similarly
structured as follows (going from the smallest unit to the largest
unit):</FONT></P>

<UL>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Word</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Field</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Record</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Database</FONT>
</UL>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Thus, a database is comprised of records
that are divided into fields made of words. In a periodical electronic
database (e.g. <I>ProQuest Direct</I>), each record includes the
citation and often may include an abstract or a full-text article.
In an online catalog, each record is the bibliographic record
which describes an item in the library (refer to module 2 lessons).
Basic fields in a record are: author field, title field, subject
field; other fields often used are: publication title field, call
number field, date field. Remember that the number of fields searchable
in a record varies with each database.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Scope of electronic databases<BR>
</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
Electronic databases have limited scope, often concentrating on
a specific subject within a specific time frame, and include only
certain type of publications. When selecting a database to use,
you need to find out about its subject and date coverage, and
the list of publications included in the database.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Electronic databases differ widely with
regards to content, focus, and format. Some databases give citations
only; others might offer abstracts (summaries of articles in a
few sentences), full text (the whole article in its entirety,
with or without illustrations), and graphics. When searching discipline-specific
databases, choose the one most appropriate for your topic; in
general, the name of the database clearly indicates its subject
coverage (e.g. Humanities Module, Law Module, Psychology Module,
etc., of <I>Proquest Direct</I>).</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Help feature of electronic databases<BR>
</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
Most electronic databases, whether library online catalogs, Web-based
search engines, or CD-ROM indexes, provide online help. In Web-based
interfaces, look for the <B>HELP</B> button on the screen and
click on the button. Take time to familiarize yourself with each
database's interface. In the Internet environment, it is often
difficult to locate the help button among all the jazzy animated
sponsoring advertisements, but if you look hard enough, you will
find the <B>HELP</B> button, generally found either at top left
or top right of the screen. <I>ProQuest Direct</I> and <I>Altavista</I>,
for example, offer excellent online tutorials on search techniques.
I would like to strongly recommend online help feature of electronic
databases because each online tutorial is customized for a specific
database.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Electronic Database Search Techniques</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">A keyword or word search is a good starting
point for a search because it allows the use of natural language,
thus it is a more flexible and easier search. When you perform
a word search, the system would look for matching terms in the
title, content, subject, notes, or author fields. An author's
last name could also be used for a word search. Word search generally
brings more returned hits and because of the great number involved,
these hits are often irrelevant, resulting in false hits or false
drops.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The opposite of a word or natural language
search is the controlled vocabulary search. The controlled vocabulary
way of searching is less flexible than word searching, but it
offers a common authoritative language that librarians, indexers
and cataloguers refer to when cataloging, indexing, or searching
for information. Most databases have their own subject heading
list, and most followed the authoritative <I>Library of Congress
Subject</I> <I>Headings</I>, published in a four-volume set.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Electronic databases, including Internet
resources, offer special search features called wildcard or truncation
searches. The symbols most often used for these searches are the
asterisk * or the question mark <B>? </B>symbols; check the help
menu of each database to see which symbol to use. For example,
if you type <B>educat*</B>, you will obtain documents containing
any of the following words: educator, educators, educating, education,
educational, educate, educates.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Boolean logic is an information retrieval
technique using the three Boolean operators AND, OR, NOT, also
AND NOT. Boolean operators are mainly used in online searching
to limit or expand the search. When using Boolean operators, it
is safer to capitalize them (e.g. AND, OR, NOT, AND NOT) although
some databases may not require capitalization. You would use:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">AND &shy; to narrow down a search (especially
when you obtain too many hits to sort through)<BR>
OR &shy; to expand a search (especially when you obtain very few
hits)<BR>
NOT &shy; to exclude an element from a subject heading within
a search</FONT></P>
