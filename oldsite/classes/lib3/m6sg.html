<P><FONT FACE="Arial">A reference book is usually not designed
for consecutive reading; it is consulted for a definite bit of
information. For example, if you were looking for brief answers
such as the pronunciation of a word, a date of birth, or statistics,
you could probably find the information in an appropriate reference
book. Dictionaries, directories, atlases, and almanacs are examples
of reference books, which contain abundant information and discrete
facts. Some reference books, such as encyclopedias, manuals, and
document collections, contain more extensive information. A third
type of reference work, indexes and bibliographies, simply refer
you to sources where you could find information on a particular
subject. The editors of such reference books have accumulated
information from many sources and have put it in a format, which
makes it more accessible. When you utilize these sources, you
will discover that much of your work has already been done for
you.<BR>
Many reference sources starts with an introductory section stating
the objectives, arrangement, and uses. Some reference works are
arranged alphabetically, this is the easiest arrangement. When
there is no alphabetical arrangement, an index is the essential
pointer to the relevant bit of information. If you are not familiar
with a particular reference tool, spend a few minutes to review
briefly the introduction. This may avoid confusion at some future
time.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Anatomy of a reference source<BR>
</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">Most reference sources are arranged
as follows:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
<U>A. Starting points</U></FONT></P>

<UL>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">a preface or an introduction stating the
  purpose of the reference work</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">a how-to-use section</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">a list of abbreviations and symbols</FONT>
</UL>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">B. Main section</FONT></U></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This is where the reference information
itself is located.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Arial">C. Index</FONT></U></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
The index usually includes author, title, subject, keyword, and
name index. The index is an essential guide to find a specific
piece of information within the content of reference work.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Before you approach a reference work, first
consider you objective in using it. Does the reference book contain
the information you need? What type and how much information are
you seeking? How old is the reference book? How reliable are the
authors or publishers? How is it arranged? Alphabetically? By
topic? By date? Does it have indexes? How many? What kind? Does
it have any special features, such as cross-references of cumulated
indexes?<BR>
In these module 5 and module 6, we will concentrate on printed
indexes, discipline-specific reference sources, and general reference
sources.<BR>
The following list of reference books is a fair representation
rather than a comprehensive listing. The questions on the assignments
are important not for their informational content but for their
illustration of some features of a reference tool in order to
familiarize you with its use.</FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="anchor142167"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Dictionaries
and encyclopedias</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The most frequently used reference in the
library is the dictionary. Some experts make a distinction between
dictionaries and encyclopedias. They say a dictionary deals primarily
with words, their meaning, spelling, pronunciation, derivation,
syllabication, and grammatical usage, while an encyclopedia deals
with information about the things named by the words. This distinction
often breaks down, however, in many large dictionaries, which
contain some information of an encyclopedic nature and much illustrative
material. Certain dictionaries, because of their unique purpose,
will not fit the foregoing description in some or any respects.
They may deal exclusively with abbreviations or synonyms, or they
may be restricted to slang terms or special subject matter, such
as anthropology or economics. Such dictionaries cover information
of an encyclopedic nature. For the purpose of this class, then,
the distinction, though noted, is less important than what a particular
dictionary or encyclopedia can do for you in your search for information.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial">The Oxford English Dictionary<BR>
</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial">Popularly known as the OED, it belongs
to the family of <I>historical origins</I> <I>dictionaries</I>.
The result of one of the most ambitious research projects in history,
The Oxford English Dictionary provides the history of every word
used in the English language since 1150. Arranged alphabetically,
it gives the derivation, spellings, meanings, and various uses
of each word. In addition, examples of the word's use are provided
by a series of quotations beginning with its first known occurrence
through current usage. When using this massive reference work,
you should first acquaint yourselves with the page found in the
front of each volume, which lists the abbreviations used.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Third Barnhart Dictionary of New English<BR>
</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial">No language is static and in the
Twentieth Century, with the massive scientific and technological
advances and the explosion of the means of communication, such
a statement was never more true. To keep up with this ever-increasing
vocabulary, dictionaries of new words are being produced.<BR>
Heavily used for information on recently coined terms that have
been created by science, technology, popular culture, and society,
this dictionary is a boon to individuals who encounter such terms.
It is arranged alphabetically by term and includes pronunciations,
definitions, etymologies, and frequency-usage notes. Every entry
has quotations on the use of the word to clarify the meaning,
and the quotations are footnoted with complete bibliographic information.</FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="anchor146266"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Subject-specific
dictionaries<BR>
</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
In nearly every field of human interest, there is a vocabulary
which is in some ways unique. There is, therefore, a need for
dictionaries in these fields to clarify what words &shy; and even
symbols &shy; mean in the context of that subject.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Dictionary of Anthropology</FONT></I><FONT
 FACE="Arial"> (by Winick)<BR>
This is a good example of a specialized dictionary containing
many terms not found I general dictionaries. Such dictionaries
are essential to clarify the &quot;jargon&quot; of particular
disciplines. Students, as well as laymen in the field, will find
this an important desk reference. It is arranged alphabetically
by keywords and has extensive cross-references.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Black's Law Dictionary<BR>
</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial">Considered the standard law dictionary,
this work provides basic definitions of legal words and terms.
Arrangement is alphabetical by term.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Dictionary of American History<BR>
</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial">A good example of a reference work
called a dictionary with all of the attributes of an encyclopedia,
this scholarly work is exhaustive in its coverage of people, places,
things, and events in American history. The arrangement is alphabetical,
but the use of the index is essential to get full use of this
excellent reference work.</FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="anchor151097"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Subject-specific
encyclopedias</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Encyclopedias are an excellent source of
general information on a number of subjects. Some encyclopedias,
such as <I>World Book Encyclopedia</I>, have short information
articles, while others, such as the <I>International Encyclopedia
of the Social Sciences</I>, have extensive scholarly articles,
usually with an analytical index. In the Liberal Arts campus Library
there are a number of excellent general encyclopedias, as well
as those dedicated to special subject areas. Although you will
be asked to review only one of the general encyclopedias, you
might note those which are available for future reference. In
the descriptions below, when mention is made to cross references,
it means that there are citations within the articles or following
them, referring the reader to other subjects within the work for
additional information. In many cases, this supplements &shy;
but does not replace- the use of the index.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial">The Encyclopedia of Philosophy</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This multi-volume set offers long authoritative
articles, signed by the authors. It is comprehensive, attempting
to cover all philosophies and periods. The arrangement is alphabetical
by broad subject, and there is an index in the last volume. This
reference includes discussions of individual philosophers, as
well as ideas. Each article is accompanied by a bibliography.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial">The New Grove Dictionary of Music and
Musicians<BR>
</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial">In every way, this reference work,
more closely fits the description of an encyclopedia than a dictionary.
It contains articles on musical terms, musical history, theory
and practice, instruments, musicians, and individual compositions,
songs, and operas. It is a standard work on the subject covering
the whole field from about 1450, with special emphasis on English
music and musicians.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial">McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science and
Technology</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">With the exception of the behavior and medical
sciences, this encyclopedia covers all branches of science and
technology. New developments are covered in annual supplements.
The concise articles are written at about the same level as articles
in Scientific American magazine. The signed articles cover both
broad and specific areas of information. Concepts are often illustrated
with photographs, drawings, and diagrams. The articles are cross-referenced
and have short bibliographies. Arrangement is alphabetical by
subject. Again, it should be emphasized, to best utilize this
work, use the index volume.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial">The Dictionary of Art (Grove)</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In every way, this reference work is similar
to its sister <I>The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians</I>,
and more closely fits the description of an encyclopedia than
a dictionary. In the words of the publisher, this is &quot;an
illustrated reference work that provided comprehensive coverage
of the history of all the visual arts worldwide, from prehistory
to present time.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">To search for subject-specific encyclopedias
and dictionaries</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Log on to Voyager, the online catalog, and

<P><CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#000099" FACE="Arial">Ready-reference
sources</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In this module, we will concentrate on ready-reference
sources that deal with facts. Librarians use ready-reference sources
to answer fact questions from patrons. Facts may no longer be
true; for example, a widely held belief in the nineteenth century
is often nullified by a twentieth century scientific discovery.
A good way to verify the fact is to locate the original source.
Most ready-reference sources, such as <I>World Almanac</I>, cite
their information sources. When evaluating a reference work, one
should look for citations to original sources of information.<BR>
The following list of reference books is a fair representation
rather than a comprehensive listing. The questions on the assignments
are important not for their informational content but for their
illustration of some features of a reference tool in order to
familiarize you with its use.</FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="anchor155504"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Almanacs,
Yearbooks</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Almanacs and yearbooks have different characters
and formats; however, their scope and function are very similar,
hence they are discussed together here as one common type of ready-reference
sources. The main difference is that the almanac contains retrospective
material not often included in the yearbook.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Almanacs</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Almanacs contain a great amount of facts
and miscellaneous information in table and textual form. Since
they are published annually, much of the information is associated
with a single year, but modern almanacs are adding more and more
historical information. Almanacs give such information as chronologies
of events of the previous years, facts about countries and their
governments, lots of statistics on populations, elections, economics,
and lists of colleges, societies, associations, and famous people.
This is a good place to look for awards and prizes, sports records,
calendars, weather, sunrise times, and high-tide times. Since
such compendiums of information do not lend themselves to an organized
arrangement, the index is essential. There is, necessarily, a
great deal of duplication of information in almanacs, but each
will have unique information. Consequently, you often have to
consult more than one almanac to find what you are looking for.
Two of the most common almanacs are listed below. The World Almanac's
index is found at the front of the book.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Information Please Almanac<BR>
World Almanac<BR>
<BR>
<B>Yearbooks</B></FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">A yearbook contains information about activities
of countries, specialized fields, or subjects in a given year.
Two of the most representative yearbooks are listed below, please
be aware that a number of them exists.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Statesman's Yearbook</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Considerable information on the nations
and international organizations is contained in this one-volume
annual. Material on each nation includes brief history and constitutional
development, government, education, economics, agricultural production,
and names of leaders. Brief statistical tables are included for
each nation. The arrangement is topical: Part I, International
Organizations; Part II, Commonwealth Nations; Part II, the United
States (with a section on each state); and Part IV, the rest of
the world. One unique feature is the section of Comparative Statistical
tables for such subjects as petroleum production and consumption,
agricultural products, and territorial sea limits.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial">The Europa World Year Book</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Europa</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial">
covers the same areas of the world in a slightly different format
than are covered in the <I>Statesman's Yearbook</I>. It has two
annual volumes. Volume I covers &quot;International Organizations,
Europe (including the USSR and Turkey).&quot; Volume II covers
&quot;Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Australasia.&quot; Although
duplicating some of the information contained in <I>Statesman's
Yearbook</I>, these two references supplement each other because
of their variant approaches and emphases. <I>Europa</I>'s statistics
for each nation, for instance, are much more complete, as are
the directories of individuals.</FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="anchor166205"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Handbooks
and Manuals</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The terms handbooks and manuals are used
interchangeably because it is difficult to differentiate between
them. Most handbooks and manuals have a limited scope with emphasis
on proven knowledge instead of current advances in research. Scientific
handbooks are published primarily for specialists in a specific
subject field, often with specialized language. <BR>
The following reference books are difficult to categorize as dictionaries,
encyclopedias, almanacs, or indexes, though they may contain collections
of information that might be considered as encompassing several
of these types of reference works. They contain a wealth of information
and are often the first place you should look for certain subjects
or certain types of information. Please be aware that these books
are just a few representatives of the library ready-reference
collection.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Masterplots</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This multivolume set contains abstracts
on the great literary works of the world. Each entry includes
such information as type of work, locale, principal characters,
summary, and critique. Arrangement is alphabetical by title of
work. This reference obviously will not replace reading a classic,
but it can provide a quick refresher of characters and plots.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Bartlett's Familiar Quotations</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Found in nearly every reference collection,
this work is one of many very useful collections of quotations
that can tell you who said or wrote a quotation with which you
are familiar. It can also provide you with a quotation on a subject
of interest to you. Some quotation books organize quotations alphabetically
by subject or author. In terms of organization, <I>Bartlett's</I>
is unique. It arranges quotations by author, not alphabetically,
but chronologically by date of birth. This is because the editors
consider the time frame to be an important addition to this type
of reference. An author and extensive subject index, however,
provide access from those points of view.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial">CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This work, revised almost annually, contains
a mass of mathematical and chemical information in tabular form.
The extensive index is arranged by broad subjects. It is a source
for information such as logarithms, square roots, molecular weight,
and formulas.</FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="anchor172258"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Biographical
sources</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">To locate a comprehensive biography of an
individual, the library catalog would be the obvious place to
look. However, if a date of birth, a bibliography of writings,
a current address, or other discrete facts are desired, there
are a number of reference works that would better serve your needs.
Reference books also frequently provide access to information
about a person when the library has no complete biography. The
following biographical sources are probably the most frequently
consulted, but it will often pay for you to seek help from the
reference librarian in locating biographical material beyond the
obvious sources.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Biography Index</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Perhaps more appropriately described in
the section on indexes, this is another excellent Wilson publication.
It contains no biographical information per se; it refers you
to sources where you can find information. It indexes biographical
material available in periodicals, individual biographies, and
collected biographies, such as <I>Ten Scientists</I> <I>Who Changed
the World</I>. Cumulated in an annual volume, this index is considered
to be a periodical. An added feature is the index which lists
the subjects of biography by such classifications as profession
and race.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial">American National Biography</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Scholarly essays by experts, often several
pages long, make up this multivolume set. It is considered the
most authoritative and famous of all American biographical sources.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Current Biography</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">One- or two-page biographical sketches with
portraits are contained in this heavily used reference work. A
short list of references appears at the end of each entry. Subjects
are persons from all professions &shy; theater, sports, medicine,
politics, business, music, etc. Although all nationalities are
covered, the bulk of the entries are for Americans. Current Biography
is a monthly publication, but it is cumulated into an annual volume.
Dating from 1940, it has a 45-year index and 10-year cumulative
indexes.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Contemporary Authors</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The subtitle, &quot;a bio-bibliographical
guide to current authors and their work,&quot; identifies the
scope of this reference work. Cumulated into semiannual volumes
with various revisions, this work includes brief personal information,
career highlights, a bibliography of the author's work, and often,
work in progress, as well as a short statement by the author.
Arrangement is alphabetical in each volume. Since the publishers
have produced several series, the use of the cumulative index
is very important. This work also indexes <I>Contemporary Literary
Criticism</I>, produced by the same publishers.</FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="anchor178172"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Directories</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Directories provide location information
on individuals, businesses, organizations, and agencies of local,
state, and federal governments. For organizations and agencies
there is frequently material on functions, membership, and assets.
A few sample directories are listed below.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Encyclopedia of Associations</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This directory lists &quot;nonprofit American
membership organizations of national scope.&quot; Each entry includes
such information as current address and telephone number, year
founded, membership, staff, purpose, meetings and conventions,
and publications. Arrangement is by very general areas of interest,
so use of the organization name and keyword index is very important.
If you have a hobby or special interest or just want more information
on one, this should often be the place to start your search.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Official Congressional Directory</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The directory includes information o departments,
commissions, independent agencies, and the judiciary, as well
as material on Congress and its functions. This is a major source
of biographies for members of Congress. New congressmen, lobbyists,
newsmen, or anyone else seeking information on Congress and its
operation in the nation's capitol would find this reference indispensable.
Arrangement is topical. An alphabetical content listing is at
the front of the book and an index of individuals at the end.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Gale Directory of Publications</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The main list, arranged by state, then city,
then publication, covers nearly a thousand pages and gives the
following information: 1) some descriptive and statistical matter
about each state; a list of its counties, marking those which
have no newspapers; and considerable gazetteer information about
each city &shy; its distance and direction from some important
place, its railroads, leading manufactures, products, and institutions,
and 2) detailed information about each paper or periodical listed,
including its name, frequency, character or politics, date of
foundation, size of column and page, subscriptions price, circulation
figures, name of editors and publishers. It has a number of classified
lists and an alphabetical index of periodicals and newspapers
at the end.</FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="anchor183619"></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Atlases and
Gazetteers</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">An <B>atlas</B> is a reference book providing
maps, plates, engravings, or charts with or without explanatory
text. It is sometimes used as the name of a volume in which subjects
are presented in tabular form. While it is generally recognized
that atlases are essential in studying history, geography, and
other branches of the social sciences, it is becoming increasingly
apparent that many atlases are valuable also as general reference
books because of the descriptive materials they contain in addition
to maps.<BR>
A <B>gazetteer</B> is a dictionary of geographical places. In
addition to geographic location, it gives historical, statistical,
cultural, and other relevant information about these places. It
may also indicate pronunciation. Because they provide a variety
of factual materials about places, gazetteers are important reference
sources. Recent editions describe a place as it is now; old editions
give historical information about it. Therefore, the economic
growth or decline of town or city, as indicated by data on population,
number of industries, schools, etc., will often be shown by the
facts given I the gazetteers over a period of time. So it is important
to note the copyright date to get some indication about the currency
of the material. A few most popular atlases and gazetteers are
listed below.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Rand McNally Commercial Atlas and Marketing
Guide</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This atlas is used extensively by manufacturing
and sales organizations. It is revised annually and is noted for
its accurate and current commercial information. Emphasis is on
the United States, but it has a small foreign section. Arrangement
is alphabetical by states, each of which is indexed individually.
The state maps are accompanied by a number of tables indicating
such commercial features as population, industries, agricultural
production, and sales data.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Times Atlas of the World</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Considered by many to be the most authoritative
and comprehensive atlas in print, this is a new edition of a reference
dating back to 1920. The introductory material is encyclopedic
in its approach. The maps are surprisingly clear, considering
the massive number of place names they contain. Elevation is indicated
by color toning. In addition to the Table of Contents, the &quot;Key
to Map Plates&quot; provides easy access to the maps. This atlas
is justifiably famous for its comprehensive index. In addition
to plate locations, it provides latitude and longitude for each
place named.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Columbia-Lippincott Gazetteer</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Of worldwide scope, this three-volume set
lists countries, regions, cities, physical features, etc. The
entries cover such brief information as pronunciation, population,
location, and key dates. If you need brief facts about a geographical
location, this is the place to look.</FONT></P>
