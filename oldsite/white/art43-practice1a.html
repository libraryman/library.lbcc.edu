		<h1>XHTML and CSS Review</h1>
		<h2>Can you find the errors in this document?</h2>

		<br />

		<p>I have created this XHTML document using the Transitional DTD. The page does not validate using the W3C validation service because of incorrect syntax and structure for XHTML 1.0 Transitional. Nor is the CSS valid.<br />

		<p>Copy this document (the code or the markup) into your editor and clean up the code. Cut and paste the code into a new document. When you have cleaned up the code, compare it with my version.</p>

		<p>One approach is to try validating the document right away, just to see all the errors it contains. Another approach is to make al the changes you think are required, and then run document through the W3C XHTML and CSS validators.</p> 

		<p>Before you begin, you might want to review <a href="http://www.nypl.org/styleguide/xhtml/guidelines.html" title="XHTML Guidelines">XHTML Guidelines</a>.</p>  
		
		<ol>
			<li>Even though the W3C can only recommend standards, we know that they are important. Briefly describe what you perceive as the important reason(s) to follow the W3C guidelines.<br />
			
				<span class="gray">Fundamentally, standards are important so that documents may be shared and read. In the long run, code that complies with standards may save time, save money, stave off obsolescence, and provide forward compatibility. </li>
				
				
			<li>Name five differences between HTML and XHTML.<br />
				<span class="gray">1)  XHTML documents contain the XML and DOCTYPE declarations at the top of the document.  The XML declaration is optional, but the DOCTYPE declaration is required.  2) XHTML documents must adhere to the syntax rules for the language.  </font><font color="#990000">XHTML is not dependent on a single document type or set of markup elements, like HTML.  XHTML can be extended or used in conjunction with other markup languages.  4) Element and attribute names must be lowercase.  5) For nonempty elements, XHTML requires end tags.documents contain the XML and DOCTYPE declarations at the top of the document. The XML declaration is optional, but the DOCTYPE declaration is required.</font><br>
				<a><br>
				</a>
			<li>What does XHTML allow you to do that HTML doesn't? How could this be beneficial to your Web site?<br>
				<font color="#990000">It allows authors to create their own tags.  </font><br>
				<a><br>
				</a>
			<li>What, in your opinion, are some difficulties Web authors face in designing across platforms and browsers? How could XHTML help in this area?  <font color="#990000">Web authors will face the challenge of writing code for many different devices.  XHTML provides for interoperability and portabilty, in anticipation of writing code for various devices, including hand-held, mobile devices. </font><br>
