	<h3>Course Requirements</h3>
	<p>The online nature of this course requires your active participation. The online environment will differ from the traditional on-site classroom environment. This course, by combining technology and innovative activities, offers you an exciting and challenging learning opportunity. During the weeks that we meet online, you will interact with your instructors and other students via an online asynchronous discussion forum and e-mail. Interaction with your classmates is of paramount importance. You are requested to be in touch with your fellow classmates at least once per module, respond to their e-mail, and offer them feedback.</p>
	
	<p> We will use the Internet to visit various websites throughout the duration of this course. We regularly check these links, but since the Web is dynamic and volatile, you may occasionally encounter a "dead" or inactive link. When this happens, please report the link to your instructors, and we will update it.</p>
	
	<p>There will be "slow times" when the network may be down or traffic is heavy. Since reading large blocks of text on your computer screen may be uncomfortable for some, we suggest that, for your convenience, you make printouts and use the hard copy for reading and annotation.</p>
	
	<p> The online class environment emphasizes student learning. Self-motivation and an ease with online technology will greatly contribute to your success in this course.</p>
	
	<p class="highlight">Please note: If you have not participated in the course for two straight weeks by either submitting an assignment or posting a message on the discussion forum, you will automatically be dropped from the class.</p>

	<p><strong><em>Value of assignments</em></strong><br />
	For most of the nine weekly assignments, you may earn up to 10 points for correct responses. One point is deducted for each incorrect answer. On some assignments, bonus points are available, as noted in the course website. If you receive less than the maximum number of points possible for a given assignment, you may revise your answers and re-submit them for re-consideration, provided they are received by your instructor prior to the final day of the semester.
				
	<p><strong><em>Value of forum postings</em></strong><br />
	Each week, a question will be posted on the discussion forum for you to rerspond to. You may earn one point for posting a thoughful, well-reasoned response to the weekly topic.
				
	<p><strong><em>Here is the point breakdown:</em></strong></p>
	
	<ul class="none">
		<li><strong>A</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89 points and above</li>
		<li><strong>B</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79-88 points</li>
		<li><strong>C</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;69-78 points</li>

To receive credit for the course, students must submit <strong>ALL 9</strong> required written assignments by the end of the course.</p>
