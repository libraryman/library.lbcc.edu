		<h1>Collection Development Policy Statement</h1>
		<h2><a id="criteria" name="criteria"></a>Selection Criteria</h2>
		
		<p><span class="first-letter">T</span>he Library applies the same criteria to all materials under consideration for inclusion in the collections, including gifts. The criteria are, as follows:</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Relevance to the curriculum and the needs of the community</li>
			<li>Authoritativeness</li>
			<li>Timeliness or permanent value of the subject material</li>
			<li>Literary quality</li>
			<li>Availability of materials on the subject and adequacy of the current collection</li>
			<li>Reviews in the professional literature</li>
			<li>Reputation of the author or publisher</li>
			<li>Inclusion in recognized bibliographies and indexes, including those of accreditation agencies</li>
			<li>Cost</li>
			<li>Condition</li>
			<li>Balance of presentation</li>
			<li>Amount of demand in the subject area</li>		
		</ol>
		
		<p>Because of limited financial resources, the following limitations will be observed in the selection of materials:</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Older and out-of-print material will not be purchased, except under special circumstances.</li>
			<li>If the Library holds material in microform or electronic format, a print copy will be purchased when warranted by use.</li>
			<li>Duplicate copies will be purchased when justified by heavy and continued use.</li>
			<li>Variant editions of a title held will be acquired only if they are standard editions, contain substantial changes, or are currently indexed.</li>
			<li>Material in languages taught at the College will receive greater consideration than material in languages not taught at the College.</li>
			<li>Textbooks for courses offered at the College are generally not purchased, unless a broader need is perceived. Supplementary course material may be purchased at the request of an instructor. Such material will be maintained in the reserve collection.</li>
			<li>Materials in a unique format, such as loose leaf or a set of separate plates, will not be purchased, unless they represent essential material that is otherwise unobtainable.</li>
		</ol>
	
		<h2><a id="reviewing" name="reviewing"></a>Reviewing Sources</h2>
		<p><span class="first-letter">F</span>ollowing is a list of reviewing sources and bibliographic tools, which are regularly reviewed by the Library faculty and may be routed to the instructional faculty for input:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><em>Black Issues</em></li>
			<li><em>Booklist</em></li>
			<li><em>Books for College Libraries</em></li>
			<li><em>Brandon/Hill Selected List of Print Books &amp;Journals in Allied Health</em></li>
			<li><em>California State Publications</em></li>
			<li><em>Choice</em></li>
			<li><em>Cr&iacute;ticas</em></li>
			<li><em>Library Journal</em></li>
			<li><em>Monthly Catalog of United States Government Publications</em></li>
			<li><em>Publisher's Weekly</em></li>
			<li><em>Selected U.S. Government Publications</em></li>
			<li>Various indexes, such as <em>Play Index and Essay and General Literature Index</em></li		
		</ul>
		
		<p>The Library generally purchases new material based on positive reviews read by at least one--preferably, two or more--librarians.</p>
		
		<h2><a id="responsibility" name="responsibility"></a> Responsibility for Selection</h2>
		<p><span class="first-letter">T</span>he Library faculty, working closely with the College community, is responsible for carrying out the Library's collection development. The Library faculty, consisting of professionally-trained librarians, has knowledge of the existing holdings, and having identified weaknesses, is equipped to give systematic attention to collection development and make acquisition decisions. The <a title="Email librarian" href="http://lib.lbcc.edu/monicawhite/monica2.html">Collection Development Librarian</a> coordinates the efforts of the Library staff in the selection of books/monographs, e-books, plays, paperbacks, videocassettes, audiocassettes, compact discs (except for ongoing subscriptions or periodical databases).</p>
		 <p>At the PCC Library, the PCC Librarians have responsibility for collection development and monitoring the PCC book budget.</p>
		 <p>To build collections that support all curricular areas, the Library seeks input from instructors, whose recommendations are given serious consideration and purchased when funding is available. The Library also encourages student recommendations. Submission of recommendations, however, does not bind the Library to acquire them. Requestors may submit their recommendations by the <a title="Book suggestion form" href="http://lib.lbcc.edu/forms/booksuggest.html">Suggestions for Book Purchases form</a> or e-mail messages to the <a title="Email librarian" href="mailto:mailto%20mwhite@lbcc.edu">Collection Development Librarian</a>, who reviews suggestions and makes recommendations based upon selection criteria and budget.</p>
		 <p>Using input from the Library staff, faculty, and students, the <a title="Email librarian" href="mailto:mailto%20nbuena@lbcc.edu">Access Services Librarian</a> is responsible for the acquisition of periodicals, newspapers, online subscriptions, and electronic databases, and microforms.</p>
		 <p>The Acquisitions/Periodical staff at each library is responsible for processing the orders. Such processing entails searching Library holdings to prevent duplication, placing the orders with particular vendors, charging funds, keeping accounting records, maintaining a file of orders in process, recording the receipt of materials, and preparing incoming materials for cataloging.</p>
		 <p>Ultimate responsibility for the selection of materials rests with the Vice President of Academic Affairs, who operates within the framework of policies determined by the Board of Trustees. </p>

		<h2><a id="deselection" name="deselection"></a>Deselection and Withdrawal of Materials</h2>
		<p><span class="first-letter">S</span>ystematic deselection or withdrawal of library materials on a regular basis is indispensible to maintaining the quality of the collection. When feasible, the participation by the appropriate faculty members is solicited in the discarding of material. Obsolete, worn-out, and inappropriate materials are removed based on the following policy. The physical condition of the collection is reviewed regularly and needed repairs to materials are made. In general, the following factors are important in considering withdrawal of a title:</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Relevance of the title to the College's teaching programs</li>
			<li>Existence of abstracts and indexes to a title</li>
			<li>Availability of the title</li>
			<li>Circulation of volumes</li>
			<li>Physical condition of volumes</li>
			<li>Input from instructors</li>		
		</ol>
		
		<p>The College's mission to support the curriculum and preserve even infrequently used materials in collected areas or in areas where the Library has an identifiable retrospective collection mitigates against large-scale weeding of materials. However, in a subject area where information is dynamic and rapidly changing, such as nursing and allied health, the currency of materials is a factor in deselection and withdrawal.</p>
		
		<p> Final disposition of discarded material is the responsibility of the College District.</p>
		
		<h2><a id="replacement" name="replacement"></a>Replacement</h2>
		<p>Material that has been lost, damaged, or is missing, is replaced by the <a title="Collection development librarian" href="http://lib.lbcc.edu/monicawhite/monica2.html">Collection Development Librarian</a>, based upon consideration of the following criteria:</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Continued value of the material</li>
			<li>Demand for the material</li>
			<li>Extent of coverage of the subject in the existing collection</li>
			<li>Availability of newer or better material in the field</li>
			<li>Cost and appropriateness of replacement rather than rebinding</li>		
		</ol>
		
		<h2><a id="reconsideration" name="reconsideration"></a>Request for Reconsideration of a Library Item</h2>
		<p><span class="first-letter">I</span>n the event that an individual requests reconsideration of an item, he/she will be asked to complete a <a title="Request for reconsideration form" href="Reconsider.pdf">Request for Reconsideration of Library Material (PDF file) form</a>. The request form will be forwarded to the Vice President of Academic Affairs, who will appoint a committee comprised of two School members and three other faculty members. The committee will review the material in question and submit a written recommendation to the Dean of Learning Resources, Teaching, &amp; Technologies and the Vice President of Academic Affairs.</p>
		
		<p>The Vice President of Academic Affairs will forward all material, with his/her recommendation, to the President/Superintendent to be presented to the Board of Trustees.</p>
		
		<p>The decision of the Board will be final. The individual requesting reconsideration of the item will be informed of the decision.</p>
