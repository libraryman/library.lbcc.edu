		<h1>Collection Development Policy Statement</h1>
		<h2><a id="scope" name="scope"></a>Scope of the Collection</h2>
		
		<p><span class="first-letter">T</span>he Library collects primary and secondary publications, bibliographic and reference resources, and machine-readable materials in the format best able to support the educational and informational needs of Long Beach City College faculty, students, and community in all subjects relevant to the College curriculum and instructional programs. In some cases, specific policies govern particular types and formats of materials.
</p>
	
	<h2><a id="formats" name="formats"></a>Formats and Coverage</h2>
	
	<h3>Books/Monographs</h3>
	<p>Every member of the faculty is encouraged to participate in the important function of book selection, based on an understanding that the extension and upgrading of the book collection to reflect the needs of the curriculum can best be accomplished through the cooperative efforts of the faculty and the Library staff. Faculty requests for books may be submited <a title="Book request form" href="http://lib.lbcc.edu/forms/booksuggest.html">online</a>, to the <a title="Email librarian" href="mailto:mailto%20mwhite@lbcc.edu">Collection Development Librarian</a>, or to <a title="Liaisons" href="3selection.html#liaisons">School Liaisons</a>. Department chairpersons who wish to receive copies of appropriate book reviews from such book selection tools as Choice should contact the Collection Development Librarian. If possible, faculty requests should be accompanied by priority designations, such as &quot;first priority,&quot; or &quot;second priority.&quot;</p>	
	<p> The Library obtains the majority of its books from a wholesale book service, Midwest. When a title is available from Midwest in a clothbound or paperback edition, the Library purchases the paperback edition, to reduce cost. Textbooks, workbooks, and study guides are only collected by exception.</p>
	
	<h3>Paperback books</h3>	
	<p>A separate collection of mass-market and trade paperbacks is maintained to support the recreational and avocational demands of the students. Because of their high usage and fragility, paperbacks in this collection receive a minimal amount of processing consistent with inventory control and circulation in a browsing collection.</p>
	
	<p>In some instances, paperback books are added to the cataloged collection. Consideration for such addtions include the following:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The title is unobtainable in another format.</li>
		<li>The title is in current heavy demand.</li>
		<li>The price of the hardbound edition is excessive.</li>
		<li>The paperback edition is purchased as a duplicate copy.</li>	
	</ol>
	
	<h3>Children's books</h3>
	<p>A separate collection of picture books is maintained to support the Child Development program and to encourage a love of reading in children. The collection reflects the multicultural population of the college community. It includes Caldecott award-winning books.</p>
	
	<h3>Career books</h3>
	<p>A separate collection of career-related books is maintained to support job exploration, job preparation, and career development. Many students seek an education to get a job, and in support of this goal, the Library strives to keep this collection current and up-to-date.</p>
	
	<h3>College catalogues</h3>
	<p>A separate collection of college catalogues and directories of educational institutions is maintained.</p>
	
	<h3>Plays (scripts)</h3>
	<p>Although a number of plays are incorporated in the cataloged collection, a separate collection of acting scripts is maintained to meet the demands of the Theater program. At least two copies of each script are purchased, and as in the case of paperback books, these materials receive a minimal amount of processing.</p>
	
	<h3>Periodicals</h3>
	<p class="highlight">Policy to be developed by the Access-services Librarian</p>
	
	<h3>Newspaper subscriptions</h3>
	<p class="highlight">Policy to be developed by the Access-services Librarian</p>
	
	<h3>Microforms</h3>
	<p class="highlight">Policy to be developed by the Access-services Librarian</p>
	
	<h3>Pamphlets</h3>
	<p>Current information in a brief format may be found in pamphlets, and they are recognized as an important informational source. The Library maintains a collection of current pamphlets. There is no specific size limit on material included in the pamphlet files, but generally, material over 40-pages long is not added. Pamphlet material of lasting value will be added to the cataloged collection. As much as possible, material for the pamphlet files will be free or inexpensive; however, essential material of a more expensive nature is purchased.</p>
	<p>Pamphlets are frequently produced by organizations and business agencies to promulgate a particular point of view. Although such pamphlets are not excluded for their bias, every effort will be made to provide material with divergent points of view.</p>
	<p>To be of maximum use, the currency of the pamphlet files is paramount. The files will, therefore, be weeded on a continuing basis.</p>
	
	<h3>Government documents</h3>
	<p>Long Beach City College Library is not designated as a depository library, and therefore, it orders Government-generated material. With the exception of continuations, emphasis will be placed on acquiring pamphlet material. Government publications that are purchased are subjected to the general guidelines and criteria. Government material of a technical nature will generally not be acquired.</p>
	
	<h3>Sound recordings</h3>
	<p>Sound recordings, including both music and spoken-word recordings, are collected and housed at the Circulation Desk as audiocassettes. At the time of the writing of this policy, the Library is evaluating the use of MP3 technology, stored on compact discs, as a more durable alternative to audiocassettes.</p>
	
	<h3>Video recordings</h3>
	<p>Video recordings, expected to be of significant long-term value in support of instruction, are collected. Videocassettes in this collection may be checked out to students for off-campus viewing. The preferred format is VHS. Priority for acquisition is given to titles requested by instructors in at least two disciplines to supplement classroom instruction and completion of assignments.</p>
	
	<h3>Compact discs</h3>
	<p>Compact discs, including both music and spoken-word recordings are available in an open collection available for browsing. Recordings requested by faculty members in support of teaching are given preference in acquisitions. The Library does not accept donations of duplicated copies of compact discs.</p>
	
	<h3>E-books</h3>
	<p>The Library recognizes the value of e-books in libraries and acknowledges their accessibility to students enrolled in online education. Under the existing budget, the Library does not have the funds to acquire an e-book collection at the consortial offering; however, the Library is currently seeking funds to initiate an e-book collection and views it as a coherent part of its overall policy.</p>
	
	<h3>DVDs</h3>
	<p>The Library does not currently collect DVDs but will consider starting a collection when DVD players are available to the faculty through Media Equipment Circulation and available to students in the Center for Learning Assistance Services.</p>
	
	<h2><a id="areas" name="areas"></a>Principal Areas of Library Collections</h2>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Circulating collections.</strong> Circulating material is acquired according to need, authority, scope, cost, treatment, arrangement, and format.</li>
		<li><strong>Reference.</strong> Reference resources are acquired according to need, authority, scope, cost, treatment, arrangement, and format.</li>
		<li><strong>Reserve Material/Textbooks.</strong> The Library maintains a reserve area where reserve material is collected, organized, and circulated. The Library does not generally purchase copies of textbooks used in classes, unless the text is considered useful to the general College community, or if the material has already been acquired in the normal course of collecting for the Library. Instructors may supply classroom or text materials and place them on reserve for students. Instructors who make materials available through the reserve collection are responsible for complying with the applicable copyright laws, as stated in the amended <a title="Copyright Act" href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/">Copyright Act of 1976</a>.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h2><a id="resource" name="resource"></a>Arrangements with Other Institutions for Resource-Sharing, Cooperative Collections</h2>
	
	<p><span class="first-letter">L</span>BCC Library recognizes that it cannot provide everything that its customers request within its own collection of resources. Therefore, the Library participates in several resource-sharing programs. As a member of Online Computer Library Center Interlibrary Loan System (OCLC), the Libraries Very Interested in Sharing (LVIS), and with reciprocal borrowing arrangements with CSU Long Beach and Long Beach Public Libraries, LBCC is committed to the cooperation and sharing of resources among libraries and other agencies that acquire, house, and make information and materials accessible. </p>
	
	<p>Interlibrary loan (ILL) serves as a means of providing access to specialized, out-of-print, and other materials the Library does not have in its collection. However, interlibrary-loan service is not a substitute for the development of adequate collections. In accordance with the National Interlibrary Loan Code, 2000, a member library should develop an adequate collection based on the needs of its service area and patrons. If a title is requested more than twice in a six-month period (and is still in print), it must be purchased. </p>
	
	<p>The Library is committed to building a collection of resources that responds to and is capable of filling most of its customers' needs. The courtesy of resource-sharing and ILL is called upon only when the Library cannot satisfy the request with its resources. The decision to purchase or borrow an item is made by the Collection Development Librarian, Access Services Librarian, and ILL-delegated staff.</p>
	
	<p>Because interlibrary loan is costly in terms of staff time for both borrowing and lending libraries, the Library may limit the number of requests an individual may make at a given time. The Library may levy a surcharge for requests that exceed a given number per year for an individual and for rush treatment of requests. </p>
	
	<p>Although the Library absorbs most of the internal costs of interlibrary loan, including most database searches and the cost of staff time involved in the process, it may pass on to the requestor any charges assessed by the lending library. Such charges may include </p>
	
	<ol>
		<li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"> loan and photocopy charges,</li>
		<li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">postage and handling fees,</li>
		<li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">lost, damaged, or overdue fees.</li>
	
	</ol>
	
	<p>LBCC Library also complies with all provisions of the U.S. Copyright Law (17 U.S.C.) and its amendments. The Library supports the Fair Use section of the Copyright Law (17 U.S.C. §107), which permits and protects citizens' rights to reproduce and make use of copyrighted works for the purposes of teaching, scholarship, and research.</p>
