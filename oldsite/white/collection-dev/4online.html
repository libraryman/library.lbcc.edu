		<h1>Collection Development Policy Statement</h1>
		<h2><a id="online" name="online"></a>Online Electronic Resources</h2>
		
		<p><span class="first-letter">O</span>nline electronic resources are defined as those that require computer access. The Library subscribes to many online electronic CD-ROM and database products. These products are primarily full-text databases that provde access to articles, statistics, and other research sources. The Library acquires electronic resources to support instruction.
</p>
	
	<h2><a id="selection" name="selection"></a>Selection Guidelines</h2>
	
	<p><span class="first-letter">T</span>he primary criteria for the selection of any online electronic product are the extent to which it is relevant to the curriculum and instructional needs of LBCC faculty, students, staff, and library personnel; improves the overall library collection; and/or enhances user access to information.</p>	
	<p> The Library participates in the consortial purchasing or leasing of databases made available through package deals and agreements with other organizations, such as the Council of Chief Librarians (CCL), the California Community Colleges (CCL-EAR Committee), and the California State University. LBCC participates in a consortium to ensure the widest possible access to online information sources. The Library also follows the proposed CCL general criteria for the selection of online databases. Demonstrations and/or trial subscriptions of online electronic resources are used at every opportunity. However, the presence or availability of online electronic or other resources on a trial basis does not necessarily mean that the Library will ultimately purchase the product.</p>
	<p> In addition to the established CCL consortium evaluation and criteria, the Library developed the following considerations for purchasing online information:</p>
	
	<h2><a id="basic" name="basic"></a>Basic Guidelines</h2>	
	
	<ol>
		<li>The intellectual content of the online electronic resource, whether purchased or free, must fit within the established parameters of LBCC Library's collection-development policy, the College's curriculum, and the Council of Chief Librarians of the California Community Colleges' criteria.</li>
		<li>The online electronic resource will provide sufficient added value over other formats.</li>
		<li>The search interface must be powerful, flexible, user-friendly, and well-indexed, with numerous points of access.</li>
		<li>Whenever possible, access to the electronic online resource must meet these goals:
			<ul>
				<li style="list-style-type: square; list-style-position: inside;">support remote users of library and information resources;</li>
				<li style="list-style-type: square; list-style-position: inside;">deliver reliable remote access to the campuses and to distance learners;</li>
				<li style="list-style-type: square; list-style-position: inside;">be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week;</li>
				<li style="list-style-type: square; list-style-position: inside;">utilize a unified and intuitive interface;</li>
				<li style="list-style-type: square; list-style-position: inside;">offer manuals, guides, and online help tutorials that are available and useful;</li>
				<li style="list-style-type: square; list-style-position: inside;">provide product reliability and the capability to support multiple simultaneous users;</li>
				<li style="list-style-type: square; list-style-position: inside;">offer downloading, exporting, and printing functions that are dependable and easy-to-use for patrons;</li>
				<li style="list-style-type: square; list-style-position: inside;"> make available usage statistics (highly desirable); and</li>
				<li style="list-style-type: square; list-style-position: inside;">ensure quality figures, graphics, and visual images that are available and acceptable.</li>				
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Cost is a major factor in selection decisions, because of continually shrinking budgets. The cost of the resource must be sustainable by the online electronic resources budget for the foreseeable future. Consideration of significant differences between online version and CD-ROM options will be made.</li>
		<li>Trial demonstration should be available before making acquisition commitment.</li>
		<li>The technology and staff to deliver and support the resource is available at LBCC Library.</li>
		<li>The Library will participate in a consortial purchase for a desired resource when the agreement provides a significant price advantage over the cost of an individual institution.</li>
		<li>Ideally, the vendor (or some other reliable source) provides for archival access to the data.</li>
		<li>The resources are updated often enough to be useful and may be directly linked to.</li>	
	</ol>
	
	<h2><a id="format" name="format"></a>Format</h2>
	
	<ol start=11>
		<li>The Library prefers Web delivery over a CD-ROM format, unless the Web version fails to meet the basic criteria for a search interface (see point 3 above) or the cost differential between the formats is significant enough to be a factor.</li>
		<li>If CD-ROM is the choice of format, the order of preferred access is:
				<ol>
					<li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">networked, remote access (WAN)</li>
					<li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">networked, library-wide access (LAN)</li>
					<li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">stand-alone (mounted on hard-drive or installed at use).</li>
				</ol>
		</li>
		<li>The resource employs (whenever possible) a user interface already familiar to the LBCC community.</li>
		<li>Ideally, the format provides a single-search access to the entire online electronic resource.</li>
		<li>The resource is compatible across a wide variety of platforms (PC, Mac, etc.); the Library will only consider platform-dependent products, if no other viable option is available, and the resource is considered essential.</li>
		<li>The Library will not support more than one version of an online electronic resource (CD-ROM, online, print and microform), unless there are overriding and compelling reasons for maintaining multiple formats.</li>
		<li>When moving an online electronic resource from one format to another, there must be compelling reasons to make the change; and the content of the new resource should be comparable or better than that of the existing format, unless others factors prevail.</li>
		<li>The vendor should be stable and reliable, and offer technical support and product maintenance.</li>
		<li>Vendors should provide options that are compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act.</li>
		<li>A trial period is available.</li>
		<li>A change of vendors will occur only when a new vendor can deliver a superior search interface, enable greater and more reliable remote access at a reasonable cost, or provide other key factors, such as archival of data.</li>
		<li>The license must be in accordance with the established CSU-SEIR electronic resource licensing policy. The license agreements should describe the rights of libraries and their authorized users in terms that are readable and explicit. Authorized users that should be included in the license are students, faculty, staff, and on-site users of the Library.</li>
		<li>Licenses should permit fair use of all information for noncommercial, educational, instructional, and research purposes by authorized users, including viewing and output (downloading, E-mail, and printing).</li>
		<li>Data on usage should be made available to the Library, and the confidentiality of individual users and their searches should be protected.</li>
		<li>The resource may be made available in agreement with the Intellectual Freedom Statement of the American Library Association, which LBCC Library fully supports.</li>
	
	</ol>
	
	<p>Other sources are also consulted for current reviews of online resources. These sources include Library Journal, American Libraries, Information Technology, and Choice. Several high-quality subject indexes are also regularly consulted, such as the Internet Public Library and The WWW Virtual Library.</p>
	
	<p> The Access Services Librarian has the primary responsibility for contacting publishers of online resources, arranging for trials or demonstrations, and negotiating agreements for the purchase or licensing of online resources. Librarians evaluate and decide on whether an online product may be made available.</p>
	
	<p> The Dean of Learning Resources, Teaching, &amp; Technologies signs all license agreements, and the Access Services Librarian is responsible for maintenance of and compliance with these agreements, according to CSU-SEIR user rights and restriction. The Access Services Librarian also adheres to ALA Access to Electronic Information, Services, and Networks: An Interpretation of the Library Bill of Rights.</p>
	
	<h2><a id="duplication" name="duplication"></a>Duplication of Materials</h2>
	
	<p><span class="first-letter">T</span>he Library will attempt to balance print, microform, and online electronic resources without unnecessary duplication. However, the Library does not expect to cancel the print and microform formats, even when digitized versions are available, until long-term access is assured, or when the Library hopes to provide an alternative. Online electronic resources may be duplicated when</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li style="list-style-type: square; list-style-position: inside;">a resource has significant historical value;</li>
		<li style="list-style-type: square; list-style-position: inside;">the format is unstable;</li>
		<li style="list-style-type: square; list-style-position: inside;">multiple formats meet the different needs of user group;</li>
		<li style="list-style-type: square; list-style-position: inside;">usage justifies additional copies in print or microform formats.</li>
	
	</ul>
	
	<h2><a id="deselection" name="deselection"></a>Deselection</h2>
	
	<p><span class="first-letter">O</span>ngoing deselection of online resources is a necessity, because of the dynamic nature of such resources. The impact on the Library's users must be considered, if online electronic access is terminated or diminished due to</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li style="list-style-type: square; list-style-position: inside;">contractual disputes or price increases;</li>
		<li style="list-style-type: square; list-style-position: inside;">access to a particular resource is not permanent, because of product changes, publishers/vendors cancellation, or technical reasons;</li>
		<li style="list-style-type: square; list-style-position: inside;">another electronic online resource offering better coverage of the same topic;</li>
		<li style="list-style-type: square; list-style-position: inside;">the resource is no longer sufficiently current or reliable.</li>
