		<h1>Collection Development Policy Statement</h1>
		<h2><a id="goals" name="goals"></a>Goals</h2>
		
		<p><span class="first-letter">T</span>he School of <a title="School of Learning Resources, Teaching and Technologies" href="http://lrtt.lbcc.edu/">Learning Resources, Teaching, &amp; Technologies</a> provides support to every major activity of the College. Greatest emphasis is given to the instructional responsibilities of the College through the selection, organization, and distribution of informational resources to students and faculty. Materials deemed to have an educational value are those that contribute to the positive growth of a person, either as an individual or as a member of society, whether that society is a peer group, the family, or the world. Materials that widen horizons, stimulate imagination and reflection, enlarge experience, and lead to personal enrichment are considered as having educational value, even as this definition enters into areas that that may more narrowly be defined as recreation or aesthetic appreciation. This policy reflects the importance of basic material of permanent value, as well as material on current issues and problems.</p>
		<p>Technology has facilitated new and additional formats for storing and delivering information; however, it is content rather than format that is given first consideration. In recognition of this principle, the Library selects resources based primarily upon content, providing students with access to information demanded by a variety of learning activities. Since the Library must be informed of forthcoming demands generated by new programs, lead time is necessary to acquire relevant materials. For this reason it is essential that the Library faculty be actively involved in the planning of any curriculum that requires information resources.</p>

	<p>In keeping with the mission of <a title="Long Beach City College" href="http://www.lbcc.edu">Long Beach City College</a>, the Library makes available an organized collection of materials and information in diversified formats, which support the instructional programs of the College. Pursuant to the College's commitment to excellence, the Library strives to build and maintain collections, which adequately support liberal arts and sciences programs that prepare students fully for transfer to four-year colleges; programs with specialized accreditation, such as nursing; vocational and technical programs; special programs for job training, retraining, or upgrading of skills through continuing and community-education services; and needed remedial programs for nontraditional or underprepared learners. The Library acquires, organizes, and provides access to a broad spectrum of materials needed to complete research assignments, classroom reports, and self-paced learning. In addition, the collections strive to support the general cultural and intellectual formation of students.</p>

	<p>The collections are organized to provide users with full, efficient, and direct access using nationally approved, standard systems, such as the Library of Congress (<a title="Library of Congress Classification" href="http://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/lcco/lcco.html">LC</a>) classification scheme and the Machine Readable Cataloging (<a title="Machine Readable Cataloging" href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/">MARC</a>) format. Uniform and multiple access through an online public access catalog (OPAC) is provided by WebVoyage, the Library's Web-based catalog, developed by Endeavor Information Systems, Inc.</p>
	
	<h2><a id="obj" name="obj"></a>Objectives</h2>
	
	<p><span class="first-letter">T</span>he primary objectives of collection development are, as follows:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>To provide materials that support the curriculum. Primary consideration is given to the development and maintenance of subject collections to support the instructional programs at Long Beach City College. The collections reflect the evolving curriculum, changing emphases, and the development of new courses and programs.</li>

		<li>To provide materials in diversified formats, including print, nonprint, computer software, and optical-storage technologies. The Library faculty is aware of the speed with which technological changes are occurring with respect to information storage and delivery and is prepared to assess and utilize new technologies for accessing information, as they are developed.</li>

		<li>To provide materials of varying complexity, in recognition of the diversity of backgrounds and skills of the College community.</li>

		<li>To provide materials representative of subjects of interest to the College community, including materials that represent multiple perspectives on controversial matters. The Library faculty seeks to select materials representing multiple viewpoints, and in carrying out its collection-development activities, the Library adheres to the principles expressed in the <a title="Library Bill of Rights" href="http://www.ala.org/ala/oif/statementspols/statementsif/librarybillrights.htm">American Library Association's Library Bill of Rights</a> and <a title="Freedom to Read" href="http://www.ala.org/ala/oif/statementspols/ftrstatement/freedomreadstatement.htm">Freedom to Read</a> statements.</li>
		
	</ol>

	<p>The Library does not promulgate particular beliefs or views, nor is the selection of any given item equivalent to endorsement of the viewpoint expressed therein. It is assumed that the essential purpose of any learning resources institution is to provide material in an atmosphere where the free individual may examine many points of view and make his or her own decision.</p>

	<p>The Library recognizes that many presentations are controversial and that any given item may offend some individuals. Selections are not made on the basis of any anticipated approval or disapproval, but solely on the merits of the work in relation to the building of the collection and to serving the interests of the College community. Since the Library is aware that one or more persons may take issue with the selection of any specific item, it welcomes the expression of opinions but does not undertake the task of pleasing all patrons by the elimination of items purchased after due deliberation under guidance of the policies expressed herein. Procedures for reviewing the presence of an item in the collection may be found below under <a title="Request for Reconsideration" href="Reconsider.pdf">Request for Reconsideration</a> of a Library Item.</p>
