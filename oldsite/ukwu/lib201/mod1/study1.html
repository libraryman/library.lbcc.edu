	<h3><a id="arrangement" name="arrangement">Library Arrangement</a></h3>
	<p>The Liberal Arts Campus Library at Long Beach City College, like a majority of academic libraries, is arranged according to function "` that is, according to what happens in a particular area. The special subject libraries also have to be arranged to take the same kind of functions into account.</p>
	
	<h4>Circulation area</h4>
	<p>The circulation desk is usually located near the library exit. Here, the material students want to check out is charged to them. There are a number of systems for such a procedure, but each is designed to assign individual responsibility for charged material. In most libraries, the exit is controlled in order that all users pass a checkpoint to insure that no library material is being removed without first having been charged out.</p>
	
	<h4>Reserve room</h4>
	<p>Instructors frequently set up a reading assignment for an entire class. If there are limited copies of the assigned material, one copy will often be placed in a reserve collection, where it can be checked out for a limited period of time "` usually one hour or overnight, depending on the length of the assignment, availability of the material, and demand. In addition to books, instructors may place periodicals, pamphlets, and even individual articles on reserve under their own name. Sometimes, instructors will place personal copies of material they own on reserve so that it can be shared with the class. At the Liberal Arts Campus Library, students request reserve material in the online catalog, where it is indexed under the instructor's name or course number.</p>
	
	<h4>Reference room</h4>
	<p>Some books are used so extensively for reference purposes that they cannot be checked out of the library. Included in this group of books are resources such as dictionaries, encyclopedias, indexes, and atlases. They are shelved in a separate area or Reference Room. The Reference Desk, frequently located in the Reference Room, is staffed by librarians, who are prepared to assist students with their information needs. In the Reference Room, talking is kept as brief and quiet as possible.</p>
	
	<h4>Pamphlet files</h4>
	<p>Much current information comes into libraries in the form of pamphlets, reprints, clippings, and brochures, published by organizations, newspapers, or frequently, governments. Information in pamphlets is often more up to date than information in books, and pamphlets are inexpensive enough to discard, as they become outdated. Because of their format and the fact that they can be easily discarded, pamphlets are not cataloged. Such materials are filed in cabinets according to the subjects they address. Most of the pamphlet files are indexed in the online catalog by subject heading. At the Liberal Arts Campus Library pamphlet files are maintained in the Reference Room. Covering approximately 3,000 different subjects, the pamphlet files are arranged alphabetically by subject. Students may check out up to ten pamphlets at a time.</p>
	
	<h4>Periodical collection</h4>
	<p>Another form of current information is the periodical. Popular magazines, specialized journals, and newspaper are included in a periodical collection. Many academic libraries maintain their periodicals in a separate area. At the Liberal Arts Campus Library, the Periodical room is staffed bull-time to provide students with assistance in locating material. If no staff person is currently attending to the Periodical Room, ask the librarian at the Reference Desk for help using the periodicals. Some periodicals titles are maintained permanently, while others are discarded after their usefulness has expired. The length of time that any title is held varies according to the subject content and interest.</p>

<p>Back issues are kept in a number of formats. Many are bound, and they look like books. These are shelved in the Periodical Room, and they are filed alphabetically by title.</p>

<p>Increasingly, libraries are becoming dependent upon microforms to maintain their periodical collections. Material from books, manuscripts, and these may also be stored on microform. Some libraries with large microform holdings even maintain a separate area for these holdings and the machines that are used with them. In all microforms, the image is photographically reduced in size. An entire shelf of material might be stored on one small reel or on several cards. Microfilm is a film transparency on a reel, which usually measures 35 millimeters. Microfiche is a transparency card, generally four-by-six inches in size. Students may use machine readers to view the contents of microfiche or microfilm. These machines shine a light through the transparent film and cast the image on a screen. There are many kinds of readers; some are manually operated, and others are automatically operated. They all work on the same principle and are relatively simple to use. The Liberal Arts Campus Library has microfilm and microfiche readers-printers, which will produce printouts at a cost of $.10 or $.20 per page, depending on the machine.</p>

<p>During the 1980, another storage format became popular in libraries: CD-ROM. CD-ROM stands for compact disc, read-only memory. This technology uses compact discs, measuring four and three-quarter inches in diameter, to store information in an electronic format. Using computer workstations, equipped with CD players and printers, students can search for information, view it on a monitor, and in some cases, print copies of articles at a cost of $.20 per page. At the Liberal Arts Campus Library there are over 500 periodical subscriptions in a CD-ROM format.</p>

<p>A number of indexes, some in print and others in electronic format, help students identify articles on a particular subject. These indexes are shelved on tables in the Reference Room.</p>

<h4>Media services</h4>
<p>Educational institutions utilize nonprint materials as supplementary tools in the learning process. In fact, colleges are generally expanding their nonprint collections, comprised of videocassettes, filmstrips, audiocassettes, records, and compact discs. With nonprint collections, there is a need for considerable audiovisual equipment, which provides access to this material. Whether it is housed in the library of somewhere else on campus, nonprint materials require special knowledge and handling. The result is often a separate Media Department within the library, staffed with professionals concerned with the informational content and production of material, and technicians concerned with maintaining and booking the equipment. Nonprint material is an integral part of individual self-instruction. Undoubtedly, computer-assisted instruction in the form of interactive, multimedia programs will become more prevalent in the future.</p>

<h3><a id="catalog" name="catalog">The Library's Online Catalog</a></h3>

<p>Every library has, in some form, a list of its holdings, designed to give users ways to find every cataloged item, if they know the author, title, or subject of the book, record, film, or other type of item they seek. Such a list is called the catalog, comprising of catalog entries or citations.</p>

<p>In the old days of card catalogs, each catalog entry, describing a single library item, was usually typed or printed on a 3-by-5-inch card (hence the name card catalog). With the advent of computerized or online catalogs, a single catalog entry is called a record. In the computer environment, databases are organized into files,and files, in turn, are organized into records. Thus, a bibliographic record is a computerized description of a single item in a collection or a database. Currently in library jargon, each catalog entry is called a bibliographic record, and it contains information about a single document or item in the library. The item could be a pamphlet, a book, a video, or a music CD.</p>

<p>The online environment providesmore access points to a document. This means that users may search for an item in the library not only by author's name, title, subject (as with the card catalog), but they may do search by keyword, call number, ISBN, and other fields.</p>

<p>A bibliographic record gives description that uniquely identify an item. The description includes, but is not limited to the following elements:</p>

<ul class="square">
	<li>Author</li>
	<li>Title</li>
	<li>Edition</li>
	<li>Date of publication</li>
	<li>Place of publication</li>
	<li>Publisher</li>
	<li>Series</li>
	<li>Physical description (e.g., number of pages, measurements, illustrations, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Users must know how to interpret a bibliographic record, identifying all the essential elements in order to write a proper citation (according to a style, such as MLA or APA).</p>

<h4><cite>Voyager</cite>, LBCC Library's online catalog</h4>

<p>The online catalog shared by the Long Beach City College libraries is a web-based system called Voyager allowing users to perform five basic searches. The logic behind the Voyager system generally applies to other library systems. While online catalogs may use different commands, they are based on a similar logic. Once you learn how to search the online catalog at Long Beach City College, you will find it easy to search the catalogs at Long Beach Public Library, California State University Long Beach, and other libraries. In this course, we will follow librarians by using the term document to indicate an item in the Library collection. Items can be books, videos, compact discs, pamphlets, etc. We would also use the term record to indicate an entry from the result list of an online database, be it a library catalog or a periodical index.</p>

<h3><a id="boolean" name="boolean">Boolean Searching</a></h3>
			<p>The term &quot;Boolean searching&quot; is based on Boolean logic&#151;a term named after George Boole, a 19th century English mathematician, who devised symbolic logic. Boolean logic is the basis for searching most computerized systems, including library catalogs.</p>
