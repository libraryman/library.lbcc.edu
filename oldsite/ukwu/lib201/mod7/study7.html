	<h2>Electronic Databases</h2>
	
	<p>After completing this module, you will know how to:</p>
	
	<ul class="square">	
		<li>select a database likely to provide information on a given topic</li>
		<li>compose search statements, and find, retrieve, and evaluate articles from Web-based databases</li>			
	</ul>
	<hr />
	
	<h2>Study Guides</h2>
	
	<ul class="none">
		<li><a title="Electronic databases" href="#electronic">Electronic Databases</a></li>
		<li><a title="ProQuest" href="#proquest">ProQuest</a></li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3><a id="electronic" name="electronic"></a>Electronic Databases</h3>
	
	<h4>Units of an electronic database</h4>
	
	<p>All electronic databases, whether online catalogs, Web search engines, or CD-ROM indexes are similarly structured as follows (going from the smallest unit to the largest unit):</p>
	
	<ul class="square">
		<li>Word </li>
		<li>Field  </li>
		<li>Record  </li>
		<li>Database </li>	
	</ul>
	
	<p>Thus, a database is comprised of records that are divided into fields made of words. In a periodical electronic database (e.g. <cite>ProQuest</cite>), each record includes the citation and often may include an abstract or a full-text article. In an online catalog, each record is the bibliographic record which describes an item in the library (refer to Module 2 Study Guides). The basic fields in a record are: author field, title field, subject field; other fields often used are: publication title field, call number field, date field. Remember that the number of fields searchable in a record varies with each database.</p>
	
	<h4>Scope of Electronic Databases</h4>
	
	<p>Electronic databases have a limited scope, often concentrating on a specific subject within a specific timeframe, and include only certain type of publication. When selecting a database to use, you need to find out about its subject and date coverage and the list of publications included in the database.</p>
	
	<p>Electronic databases differ widely in regard to content, focus, and format. Some databases give citations only; others might offer abstracts (summaries of articles in a few sentences), full text (the whole article in its entirety, with or without illustrations), and graphics. When searching discipline-specific databases, choose the one most appropriate for your topic. In general, the name of the database clearly indicates its subject coverage (e.g. Humanities Module, Law Module, Psychology Module, etc., in <cite>Proquest</cite>).</p>
	
	<h4>Help Feature of Electronic Databases</h4>
	
	<p>Most electronic databases, whether library online catalogs, Web-based search engines, or CD-ROM indexes, provide online help. In Web-based interfaces, look for the <strong>HELP</strong> button on the screen and click on the button. Take time to familiarize yourself with each database's interface. In the Internet environment, it is often difficult to locate the help button among all the jazzy, animated  advertisements, but if you look hard enough, you will find the HELP button, generally found either at top left or top right of the screen. <cite>ProQuest</cite>, for example, offers excellent online tutorials on search techniques. I strongly recommend that you make use of the online help feature of electronic databases, because each online tutorial is customized for a specific database.</p>
	
	<h4>Electronic Database Search Techniques</h4>
	
	<p>A keyword or word search is a good starting point for a search, because it allows the use of natural language, thus it is a more flexible and easier search. When you perform a word search, the system  looks for matching terms in the title, content, subject, notes, and author fields. An author's last name could also be used for a word search. Word search generally brings more returned hits and because of the great number involved, these hits are often irrelevant, resulting in false &quot;hits&quot; or false &quot;drops.&quot;</p>
	
	<p>The opposite of a word or natural language search is the controlled vocabulary search. The controlled vocabulary way of searching is less flexible than word searching, but it offers a common authoritative language that librarians, indexers, and catalogers refer to when cataloging, indexing, or searching for information. Most databases have their own subject heading list, and most follow the authoritative <cite>Library of Congress Subject Headings</cite>, published in a four-volume set.</p>
	
	<p>Electronic databases, including Internet resources, offer special search features called wildcard or truncation searches. The symbols most often used for these searches are the asterisk * or the question mark ? symbols; check the help menu of each database to see which symbol is used. For example, if you type <strong>educat*</strong>, you will obtain documents containing any of the following words: educator, educators, educating, education, educational, educate, educates.</p>
	
	<p>Boolean logic is an information-retrieval technique using the three Boolean operators AND, OR, NOT, also AND NOT. Boolean operators are mainly used in online searching to limit or expand the search. When using Boolean operators, it is safer to capitalize them (e.g. AND, OR, NOT, AND NOT) although some databases may not require capitalization. You would use</p>
	
	<p class="box">AND&#151;to narrow a search (especially when you obtain too many hits to sort through)<br />OR&#151;to expand a search (especially when you obtain very few hits)<br />NOT&#151;to exclude an element from a subject heading within a search</p>

	<h3><a id="proquest" name="proquest"></a>ProQuest</h3>
	
	<p>ProQuest is an electronic periodical index, available via the Internet. ProQuest provides you with citations, abstracts, indexing, and in some cases, the full text of articles from academic and trade journals, popular magazines, and newspapers.</p>
