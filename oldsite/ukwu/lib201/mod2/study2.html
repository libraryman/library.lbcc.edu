	<h3><a id="class" name="class"></a>Classification Systems</h3>
	
	<p>From the time humans first began amassing a culture's written records into libraries, they have attempted to arrange records in some reasonable order. With today's massive collections, classification systems have become quite extensive and involved. There are two classification systems:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Dewey Decimal Classification</li>
		<li>Library of Congress Classification</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h4>Dewey Decimal Classification</h4>
	
	<p>This was, for many years, the most common classification system used by libraries, and it is still used by many public and school libraries today.</p>
	
	<p>Dewey developed his system predicated on the idea that the major areas of knowledge could be divided into ten major divisions of three-digit numbers (000, 100, 200, etc. to 900). For example, all of the numbers between 500 and 599 deal with some aspect of a single subject ­ pure science. Each of these divisions is, in turn, divided into ten subdivisions (510, 520, 530, etc.). Any book, then, with the exception of fiction, is classified with a number between 001 and 999.</p>
	
	<p>Since greater refinement is often necessary, a further series of decimal numbers is employed to increase the distinction in subject matter. At times, the use of decimal numbers causes difficulty for library users and perpetuates the myth that there is some mystery that only librarians can fathom in locating a classified book. However, once students understand the use of decimals, there is no mystery to the sequence.</p>
	
	<p>Every Dewey number has at least three digits. They are shelved in a numerical sequence. Thus, 001 precedes 099, which precedes 100.</p>
	
	<p>Any digits, which follow the first three, are decimal numbers. Thus, in the classification numbers 910.305 and 910.35, the digits following the decimals (.305 and .35) are arranged decimally, rather than numerically. Thus:</p>
	
	<p class="box">910 precedes 910.09, then 910.3, then 910.305, then 910.35.</p>
	
	<h4>Library of Congress Classification</h4>
	
	<p>LC is a classification system established by the United States Library of Congress, and it is the preferred classification system of academic and research libraries. Since the Library of Congress utilizes most of the letters of the alphabet for major divisions, a second letter for subdivisions, and a series of numbers for further refinement, the possibilities for expansion are much greater than with the Dewey Classification system.</p>
	
	<p>Students familiar with the decimal classification are sometimes confused by the use of letters. Overall, students tend to find the Library of Congress Classification a simpler system, once they discover that it, too, is merely a sequence utilizing letters, as well as numbers.</p>
	
	<p>Accordingly, D precedes DA; DA precedes DC; DC precedes DD; DD precedes E, etc.</p>
	
	<table width="400" style="border: 1px solid silver;">
			<tr>
				<td class="example">D<br />9<br />.B7</td>
				<td class="example">D<br />31<br />.G51</td>
				<td class="example">D<br />301<br />.A3</td>
				<td class="example">D<br />1001<br />.F3</td>
				<td class="example">DA<br />1<br />.A32</td>
			</tr>
	</table>
	
	<p>Occasionally, a decimal number appears in a Library of Congress Classification number. It is, of course, shelved decimally. Thus:</p>
	
	<table width="400" style="border: 1px solid silver;">
			<tr>
				<td class="example" valign="top">D 8410<br /> precedes</td>
				<td class="example" valign="top">D 8410.12<br />which<br />precedes</td>
				<td class="example" valign="top">D 8410.5<br />and<br />before</td>
				<td class="example" valign="top">D841</td>
			</tr>
	</table>
	
	<h3><a id="lcsh" name="lcsh"></a>Library of Congress Subject Headings</h3>
	
	<p>The <cite>Library of Congress Subject Headings</cite> (LCSH) refers to a set of four large red books, usually shelved in a library's Reference Collection.</p>
	
	<p>The LCSH is based on the concept of &quot;controlled vocabulary.&quot; When searching for information from print indexes or card catalogs, the searcher's subject terms must match those of the indexer. For example, if the searcher finds no items indexed under the term &quot;death penalty,&quot; it is because the indexer uses a different term, in this case &quot;capital punishment.&quot; Sometimes, crossreferences lead a searcher to the correct term to use. Hence, the system is predicated on a set of standard subject headings to assign to concepts&#151;a sort of common language.</p>
	
	<p>The LCSH was created to fill the need for a controlled vocabulary of subject headings, upon which indexers and catalogers rely to find the proper terminology for indexing and cataloging library materials. LCSH establishes a controlled-vocabulary environment with predetermined subject headings.</p>
	
	<p>The LCSH is updated regularly to reflect changes in language and culture. For example, the following subject 
	headings, reflecting changes in American life and culture, were recently added: AIDS, Internet, and cyberpunk. </p>
	
	<p>Subject headings are listed in boldface type, e.g., <strong>Motorboats</strong>, <strong>Agricultural machinery</strong>, 
	<strong>Drugs</strong>. A heading may be followed by the note, (May Subd Geog), indicating that the heading may be 
	subdivided into geographic locations. Subject headings may consist of one word or several words. A one-word heading  
	often consists of a noun, e.g., Motorboats; two-word headings are usually composed of an adjective and a noun, e.g. 
	Agricultural machinery.</p>
	
	<p>Subject headings often include abbreviations denoting hierarchical relationships between various topics. It's important for you to become familiar with these abbreviations. Refer to the introductory chapter at the beginning of a volume in the LCSH set to learn how to interpret the entries. In general, it is a good habit to consult the how-to-use section of a reference work before attempting to use it. The how-to-use section may consist of an instructional preface or introduction.</p>
	
	<p>Here is an example of an entry from the <cite>Library of Congress Subject Headings</cite>:</p>
	
	<table width="400" style="border: 1px solid silver;">
			<tr>
				<td class="example" valign="top">
Agricultural machinery (May Subd Geog)<br />
[S671-S760]<br />
UF Agriculture - Equipment and supplies<br />
Crops - Machinery<br />
Farm machinery<br />
BT Machinery<br />
RT Farm equipment<br />
Farm mechanization<br />
Machine-tractor stations<br />
SA subdivision Machinery under names of<br />
crops, e.g. Corn - Machinery<br />
NT Agricultural implements<br />
Agricultural instruments
				</td>
			</tr>
	</table>
	
	<p>In the example above outlining the subject heading &quot;Agricultural machinery,&quot; we see that this term may be subdivided 
	geographically, as indicated by the note &quot;(May Subd Geog).&quot; Furthermore, [S671-S760] indicates the class number to use 
	when cataloging books in this subject matter. Here is the meaning of the following abbreviations:</p>
	
	<p><strong>UF</strong> indicates that the heading &quot;Agricultural machinery&quot; is <strong>Used For</strong> those 
	listed after UF, i.e., &quot;Agriculture - Equipment and supplies,&quot; &quot;Crops - Machinery,&quot; &quot;Farm 
	machinery&quot;</p>
	
	<p><strong>BT</strong> indicates that the <strong>Broader Topic</strong> for &quot;Agricultural machinery&quot; is 
	&quot;Machinery&quot;</p>
	
	<p><strong>RT</strong> indicates that the <strong>Related Topic</strong> for &quot;Agricultural machinery&quot; is 
	&quot;Farm equipment,&quot; &quot;Farm mechanization,&quot; and &quot;Machine-tractor stations&quot;</p>
	
	<p><strong>SA</strong> refers to those subjects which a user could &quot;<strong>See Also</strong>&quot;</p>
	
	<p><strong>NT</strong> indicates that the <strong>Narrower Topic</strong> for &quot;Agricultural machinery&quot; is &quot;Agricultural 
	implements,&quot; &quot;Agricultural instruments&quot;</p>
	
	<p>Let's look at one example of a hierarchical relationship:</p>
	
<table width="400" style="border: 1px solid silver;">
<tr>
<td class="example" valign="top">
Vehicles<br />
BT Transportation<br />
NT Motor vehicles<br />
Motor vehicles<br />
BT Vehicles<br />
NT Trucks<br />
Trucks<br />
BT Motor vehicles<br />
NT Dump trucks<br />
Dump trucks<br />
BT Trucks</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The hierarchical tree above provides a clearly defined organization of the tree-like structure for the subject term &quot;Transportation.&quot; 
The branches of the tree, so to speak, are reprersented by the terms &quot;Vehicles&quot; and &quot;Motor vehicles.&quot; And the twigs are &quot;Trucks&quot; and &quot;Dump trucks.&quot; This example illustrates the way in which users can follow the hierarchy from the narrowest topic, &quot;Dump trucks,&quot; to the broadest topic, &quot;Transportation.&quot;</p>
