	<h2>Assignment 4: Evaluating Information</h2>

	<p>Please answer the following questions and submit your answers as an e-mail to Instructor Monica White, <a title="Email Monica White" href="mailto:%20mwhite@lbcc.edu">mwhite@lbcc.edu</a>. Please be sure to type the question number, then type your answer.</p>
	
	<p>The purpose of this assignment is to</p>
	
	<ul class="square">
		<li>practice evaluating information</li>
		<li>practice citing information</li>
	</ul>
	
	<hr /><br />
	
	<h3>Part I: Books</h3>
	
	<p>Using the research topic you selected in Module 3, search <cite><a title="Voyager online catalog" href="http://voyager.lbcc.edu">Voyager</a></cite> or any other library catalog for relevant information. Look over the results list and select three books that you think are most likely to provide the information you need. Explain your rationale for selecting them. The bibliographic record will provide you with sufficient information to answer the questions below. However, it is best that you come into the library and examine the books. For each book selected, give a detailed description about it and its appropriateness to your topic.</p>
	
	<p>Factors that weigh in your decision should include the following:</p>
	
	<ul class="square">
		<li> What do you know about the author?</li>
		<li>Is he/she a specialist in his/her field and the author of many books?</li>
		<li>The library catalog provides links to other works by the same author in the library's collection. In addition to the catalog, print references, such as <cite>Books in Print</cite>, <cite>Book Review Digest</cite>, and <cite>Contemporary Authors</cite> are 
		excellent resources for learning about an author's body of work; search under the author's last name.</li>
		<li>What does the subject content of the book tell you about its relevancy to your topic?</li>
		<li>Does the title reflect the book's subject?</li>
		<li>Is the publisher from a respected and well-known publishing house? (Again, search the library catalog to find out how many of this publisher's books the library owns.) Does the publisher produce many books on a certain subject?</li>
		<li>Is currency important to your topic and if so, why?</li>
		<li>Does the book provide serious information, or is it propagandistic and have an agenda? (Often times, the book's jacket provides an indication about the nature of a book.)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Part II: Periodicals</h3>
	
	<p>In the following exercises you will draw comparisons between a popular magazine and a scholarly journal.
The main purpose of this assignment is to compare the contents (type, length, and quality of articles) and the presentation (type and quality of graphics, advertisements) of the two different types of periodicals.
Select one scholarly journal and one popular magazine of your choice.</p>

<ol type="A">
	<li>Leaf through the entire issue of each periodical and briefly scan through the articles in each periodical.</li>
	<li>Draw comparisons by listing characteristics of each periodical. You may create two separate columns, one for each periodical, or you may write a paragraph for each periodical. Whatever format you choose, please answer the following questions for each periodical:<ol type="1">
			<li>Is such information as the expertise and the qualifications of the author of the article included?</li>
			<li>What is the nature and length of most articles?</li>
			<li>Are there advertisements? What kind and how many?</li>
			<li>Is there a bibliography at the end of each article?</li>
			<li>Are there graphics and if so are they educational, promotional, or decorative?</li>
			<li>What are the similarities and differences between the two publications?</li>
