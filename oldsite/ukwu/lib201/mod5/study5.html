	<h2>Print Indexes</h2>
	
	<p>After completing this module, you will know how to:</p>
	
	<ul class="square">	
		<li>interpret a citation from an index</li>
		<li>identify main subject headings</li>
		<li>select an appropriate index for a particular topic</li>			
	</ul>

		<li><a title="Specialized Indexes" href="#specialized">Specialized Indexes</a></li>	
	</ul>
	
	<p>An index is a pointer to a piece of information in periodicals or in books and does not contain the information itself. An index is arranged in a certain order designed to guide users to the needed piece of information, be it an article in a periodical or a chapter in a book. The goal of indexes is to guide users to the intellectual content and the physical location of documents.</p>
	
	<p>There are two types of indexes:</p>
	
	<ul class="square">
		<li>Book indexes</li>
		<li>Periodical indexes</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3><a id="book" name="book"></a>Book Indexes</h3>
	
	<p>A book index provides a pointer to the information included in the book; a book index is arranged alphabetically, gives a page location, and is usually found at the back of the book.  Examples of information likely to be contained in the index of a travel book, for instance, would be place names, historical events or historical sites, hotels, and resorts. An index in a cookbook would probably include ingredients, recipes, measurements, and culinary activities.</p>
	
	<p>Before going further, you should first become familiar with the following terms:</p>
	
	<p>A <strong>periodical</strong> is a publication with a fixed interval between issues or numbers, such as weekly, monthly, or quarterly. Examples of periodicals are <cite>Newsweek</cite>, <cite>Business Week</cite>, and <cite>National Review</cite>.</p>
	
	<p>A <strong>journal</strong> is a publication dealing with a specialized subject, containing articles written by experts in the field. Journals tend to be scholarly in nature and research-oriented, in which the results of primary research are reported. The articles published in journals frequently have abstracts&#151;i.e., summaries&#151;and bibliographies. Examples of journals are <cite>American Journal of Psychology</cite> and <cite>Journal of the American Medical Association</cite>.</p>
	
	<p>A <strong>magazine</strong> is a popular publication of general interest, which is usually written in nontechnical terms and frequently has illustrations. Examples are <cite>National Geographic</cite> and <cite>Sports Illustrated</cite>. </p>
	
	<p>Refer to Module 4 on evaluating information to distinguish a popular magazine from a scholarly journal.</p>
	
	<h3><a id="periodical" name="periodical"></a>Periodical indexes</h3>
	
	<p>Periodical indexes are much different than book indexes. In general, a book is written by one author, on a specific topic, with a single focus from the beginning to the end. In contrast, a periodical is open-ended, with contributions from different authors, using different styles, writing on different subjects. From this vast amount of information, indexes must create some order and provide a clear and standardized arrangement to guide users to the right document. There are two types of periodical indexes:</p>
	
	<ul class="square">
		<li>Individual indexes</li>
		<li>Broad indexes</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>An individual index only indexes a specific periodical, for example: <cite>National Geographic</cite> index  covers only articles from <cite>National Geographic</cite> magazine; <cite>Los Angeles Times</cite> index covers only articles from the <cite>Los Angeles Times</cite>.</p>
	
	<p>Broad indexes cover articles from thousands of periodicals. There are broad indexes that are general (e.g. <cite>Readers' Guide to Periodical Literature</cite>), and there are broad indexes that are discipline-specific (e.g. <cite>Business Periodicals Index</cite>).</p>
	
	<p>Periodical indexes are published in various formats: print, microform, CD-ROM, electronic. In this Lib 1 course, we will concentrate on print and electronic periodical indexes.</p>
	
	<h3>Print periodical indexes</h3>
	
	<p>The Liberal Arts Campus Library subscribes to many print periodical indexes, which are published by the H.W.Wilson Company. Print indexes are updated monthly and sent to libraries in soft-cover editions. At the end of a twelve-month period, they are bound in an annual volume with the corresponding year clearly marked on the spine.</p>
	
	<p>Print indexes are arranged alphabetically by author and subject headings with subdivisions. Users search under headings to locate relevant periodical articles; each article listing is called a citation. One main disadvantage of using print indexes is that users still need to go to the periodical shelves and look for the article in the correct periodical, which sometimes is not available due to loss or checkout by another user. The main advantage of print indexes is that users can search for retrospective information published in the past. For example, the <cite>New York Times Index</cite> goes as far back as 1851.</p>
	
	<p>Here are some of the print indexes available at the LAC Library:</p>
	
	<ul class="none">
		<li><cite>Art Index</cite></li>
		<li><cite>Business Periodicals Index</cite></li>
		<li><cite>Education Index</cite></li>
		<li><cite>Social Sciences Index</cite></li>
		<li><cite>Humanities Index</cite></li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Since the form, arrangement, and frequency of these indexes are similar, only one index will be described in detail below:</p>
	
	<p><cite>Readers' Guide to Periodical Literature</cite></p>
	
	<p>This index covers approximately 190 general-interest periodicals, such as <cite>Time</cite>, <cite>Ebony</cite>, <cite>Scientific 
	American</cite>, and <cite>People Weekly</cite>. The arrangement is by specific subject in one alphabet. There are many crossreferences. Under the subject, each entry lists articles by title, author, name of the periodical (in italics and usually abbreviated), volume, pages, and date.</p>
	
	<h3>Electronic periodical indexes</h3>
	
	<p>Many electronic indexes are updated daily and offer choices of searches not available in print indexes. Users can choose an unstructured keyword search, or publication search, or a structured advanced search within a specific date range. Electronic indexes offer a one-stop-shop experience in that users obtain not only citations but also abstracts and the full text of articles with printing, downloading, and e-mailing capabilities. The main disadvantage of electronic indexes is that most of their databases index content published around the 1980s when these databases were first produced. So, if users want to find retrospective periodical articles published prior to the 1980s, they have to use print indexes. In Module 7, we will explore an electronic periodical subscription available via the LBCC Library website: <cite>ProQuest</cite> (comprised of numerous discipline-specific databases)</p>
		
	
	<h3><a id="specialized" name="specialized"></a>Specialized indexes</h3>
	
	<p><strong><cite>Granger's Index to Poetry</cite></strong><br />This index has been around for a long time, and it will help you locate poems in collections. Each volume is organized in the same way and is comprised of several sections. In the back of the volume, there is a subject index and an author index. The major section is a title and first-line index in one alphabet. Each entry lists the anthologies in which the poem appears. All of the books indexed are listed in the front of the volume. If an anthology is available at the Liberal Arts Campus Library, the call number is pencilled in next to the title.</p>
	
	<p><strong><cite>Short Story Index</cite></strong><br />These volumes index short stories in collections. The main section lists short story titles, authors, and subjects in one alphabet. The author entries list every short story by that author and the anthology where each one can be found. The anthologies are listed in the back of each volume. If the anthology is available in the Liberal Arts Campus Library, the call number is written next to the title entry.</p>
	
	<p><strong><cite>Essay and General Literature Index</cite></strong><br />Every year, essays are published in collections on many subjects. This index lists these essays by author, about the author, and about individual works by authors. In addition, it indexes essays by subject. Each entry lists the author and the title of the essay, lists the books in which it is published, as well as its page numbers. The books indexed are listed in the back and those owned by LBCC Library have the call number written next to the title.</p>
	
	<p><strong><cite>Play Index</cite></strong><br />The <cite>Play Index</cite> is published every five years. It indexes 
	plays that were published during a given five-year period. Plays which were omitted from the previous volume are 
	included in the current volume. In the words of the publisher, each volume &quot;contains both separately published 
	plays and plays in collections, written in or translated into English. Its broad scope ­ from puppet plays to 
	classical drama ­ and detailed cast analysis make <cite>Play Index</cite> suitable for a variety of uses.&quot; It is a combined title, author, and subject index arranged alphabetically.</p>
