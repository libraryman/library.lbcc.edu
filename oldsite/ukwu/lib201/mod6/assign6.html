	<h2>Assignment 6: Reference Resources</h2>
	
	<p>The purpose of this assignment is to give you hands-on practice using reference resources. You will learn about the content and arrangement of some of the most-used reference tools in the library. As a result, you will acquire the skills necessary to identify and evaluate the similarities and differences between reference works.</p>
	
	<h3>Instructions</h3>
	
	<p>Take time to become acquainted with each reference resource: read the &quot;how-to-use&quot; chapter and refer to the list of 
	abbreviations and symbols to help you interpret the information contained within. Read the instruction for each question carefully and 
	answer all pertinent questions on a separate sheet. <strong>Many reference sources form a multivolume set; always check the index volume 
	first to find the correct volume in which to find the answer</strong>.</p>
	
	<p>If one of the resources you need is not on the shelf where it belongs, and you cannot find it, just 
	write "<dfn title="Not On Shelf"><abbr>NOS</abbr></dfn>" as your 
	answer. <dfn title="Not On Shelf"><abbr>NOS</abbr></dfn> stands for "not on shelf."</p>
