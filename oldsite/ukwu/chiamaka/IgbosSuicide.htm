<P><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;</font><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Chinua 
  Achebe discussed several customs and beliefs of the Igbo people in his powerful 
  novel, <I>Things Fall Apart</I> . One of the issues he discussed was how the 
  Igbos viewed suicide.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Suicide is intolerable 
  in Igbo society even in this modern time. It is considered an <I>"nso ani"</I>, 
  a sin against the Earth. The Igbos do not concede to the difficulties of life 
  or to the demands of everyday life. They do not accept suicide, in any form 
  and at any age, as a solution to any problem regardless of the complexities. 
  Suicide is believed to be a terrible and evil way to die.<BR>
  <BR>
  The Igbos strongly believe in reincarnation. Reincarnation is one of the ways 
  they share their love with their loved ones who have passed. Consequently, death 
  by suicide is believed to be an evil act and "a bad death." If one commited 
  suicide, that person was never (and will never be) at peace with him/herself, 
  the community (i.e. village), relatives, and most importantly the gods. Only 
  people who lived and died a "good" death reincarnate. A person who died a "bad" 
  death does not (and should not be allowed) to reincarnate.<BR>
  </font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Igbos scorn 
  murder and the penalty for murder can be extremely severe for the murderer or 
  murderess and their family members depending on the murder case (i.e. if the 
  murder was an accident, if the murderer was caught red-handed or if one is suspected 
  of actually committing the crime). At the minimum, the punishment for murder 
  may include ostracism of the suspected murderer or murderess and their family 
  members from society. Otherwise, the penalty for murder is banishment of the 
  murderer or the murderess from the village or death. If the murder was committed 
  by poisoning the victim, or if a victim died under an obscure or suspicious 
  circumstance, an abominable curse may be placed on those who might have committed 
  the murder. In <I>Things Fall Apart,</I> Okonkwo was forced to leave Umuofia 
  for a seven year exile in his mother's village for accidentally killing a clansman. 
  Achebe explained that Okonkwo did not receive a more severe punishment because 
  the crime was categorized as "a female" (i.e. lighter offense) since it was 
  an accident. Hence, he would have been severely punished by the gods and the 
  people and possibly banished from his village for life.<BR>
  <BR>
  The above methods of punishment are nothing comapared to those for committing 
  suicide. Suicide is considered more evil than murder in Igboland. Suicide is 
  a shame to the family, the village, and the town of the deceased. It creates 
  problems and severe consequences for the deceased's family. Since it is considered 
  an abominable manner to die, grownup ladies in the family may not have "good" 
  suitors. The men will also have problems marrying from a "good" family.<BR>
  <BR>
  Suicide is considered an omen. As a result, detailed ceremonies were performed 
  when one commits suicide to completely exorcise the deceased's spirits and to 
  calm or eradicate the evil spirits of the dead and to appease the gods. In <I>Things 
  Fall Apart,</I> Okonkwo was a great warrior and wrestler, took the <I>ozo </I>title 
  in Umuofia, faught very hard to preserve his tradition and ended up committing 
  the most horrendous of all offenses against the earth goddess--take his own 
  life. His clansmen can neither touch his corpse nor bury him with all the rites 
  due a great warrior and an <I>ozo</I> as they did when Ogbuefi Ezeudu died. 
  The elders would offer sacrifices to cleanse the desecrated ground which Okonkwo 
  had polluted.<BR>
  <BR>
  On pages 207-208 of this novel, Achebe recounted the conversation between Obierika, 
  Okonkwo's clansman and friend, and the District Commissioner:</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then they came 
  to the tree from which Okonkwo's body was dangling, and they stopped dead.<BR>
  </font></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Perhaps 
  your men can help us bring him down and bury him," said Obierika. "We have sent 
  for strangers from another village to do it for us, but they may be a long time 
  coming."<BR>
  <BR>
  "Why can't you take him down yourselves?" he (i.e. the District Commissioner) 
  asked.<BR>
  <BR>
  "It is against our custom," said one of the men. It is an abomination for a 
  man to take his own life. It is an offense against the Earth, and a man who 
  commits it will not be buried by his clansmen. His body is evil, and only strangers 
  may touch it. That is why we ask your people to bring him down, because you 
  are strangers."<BR>
  <BR>
  "Will you bury him like any other man?" asked the Commissioner.<BR>
  <BR>
  "We cannot bury him. Only strangers can. We shall pay your men to do it. When 
  he has been buried we will then do our duty by him. We shall make sacrifices 
  to cleanse the desecrated land."<BR>
  <BR>
  Obierika turned suddenly to the District Commissioner and said ferociously: 
  "That man was one of the greatest men in Umuofia. You drove hime to kill himself; 
  and now he will be buried like a dog ..."<BR>
  </font></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The above scenario 
  from <I>Things Fall Apart</I> is a fact not fiction about the Igbo people's 
  view of suicide. In Igboland, if suicide was committed by hanging from a tree, 
  not everyone was permitted to touch or to bring the corpse down from the tree. 
  When the corpse is finally brought down, able-bodied men in the community will 
  cut that tree down with very sharp cutlass and axe for several reasons. First, 
  as a precaution to prevent another person from committing suicide on the same 
  tree. Second, the tree is regarded as an "evil" or "bad" tree.<BR>
  <BR>
  If suicide was committed inside the house, that house is supposed to be destroyed 
  to prevent another suicidal attempt by someone else. In some villages, if suicide 
  is committed inside a house, nothing can be removed from that house. The house 
  will be destroyed along with everything in it. The body is taken to an evil 
  forest, and buried there.<BR>
  <BR>
  If suicide was committed inside a yam barn, no yams would be removed from the 
  barn. All will be destroyed. At times, a servant who is maltreated by a master 
  may retaliate by committing suicide between the entrance to the animal house 
  and the yam barn. In this case, nothing would be removed from the master's barn 
  or from the animal house. Everything would be destroyed and the master would 
  loose everything.<BR>
  <BR>
  If the suicide took place in the farm land, the grave is dug directly under 
  the hanging spot. When the rope is cut, the corpse falls directly into the grave.<BR>
  <BR>
  When suicide is commited by drowning in a water well, that well is filled up 
  with sand and closed for forever.<BR>
  <BR>
  There is no fitting funeral ceremony for someone who committed suicide, even 
  at an old age. No one is allowed to cry or weep publicly for the deceased. There 
  is no wake, cooking, or drinking. Finally, cleansing ceremonies are performed 
  by the deceased's family so that such an evil will not happen again. The elders 
  would offer sacrifices for peace in the land, and for the extinction of such 
  thought and illness from the land.<BR>
  <BR>
  The Igbos celebrate death as they do <A HREF="igbonames.htm">birth</A>. Death 
  at an old age is regarded as a blessing and is celebrated with feasting. In 
  <I>Things Fall Apart,</I> when Ogbuefi Ezeudu died, the people of Umuofia celebrated 
  his death with lots of food, drinking, and dancing. The nine respresentatives 
  of the ancestral spirits, the <I>egwugwu,</I> and various types of masquerades 
  came to pay their last respect. There were gun salutes, "the beating of drums 
  and the brandishing and clanging of machetes ..." (p.123). He was given a befitting 
  burial because he was a wrestler, warrior, an <I>ozo </I>(a titled man, he took 
  three of Umuofia's four titles in his lifetime), and was one of the oldest men 
  in Umuofia.<BR>
  <BR>
  In the modern world, chiefs, and other well-known people are preserved when 
  they die and are buried several months after their death due to the preparations 
  involved. The body will lie in state at which time friends and relatives pay 
  their last respects to the dead. The corpse is clothed in beautiful garments 
  and the room and bed are colorfully decorated. Elders are usually buried in 
  the family's compound. A chief is normally buried inside his <I>"obi"</I> (his 
  palace or meeting place). The head of the family may be buried inside, in the 
  front, or to the side of his house, so as to continue his bond with the living. 
  Inspite of the introduction of christianity to Igboland, Igbos still maintain 
  close ties to their ancestors and ancestral spirits. Elders still pour libations 
  to and share kolanuts with their ancestors.<BR>
