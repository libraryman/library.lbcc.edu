  In the novel, <I>Things Fall Apart,</I> Chinua Achebe provided a vivid picture 
  of the Igbos, especially highlighting their social life and customs, religious 
  beliefs, seasonal festivals, ceremonies, myth, political structures and their 
  rich traditional wisdom handed down from one generation to another through oral 
  history and proverbs.<BR>
  <BR>
  <B>Makeup or Body Decoration<BR>
  </B><BR>
  Achebe described various aspects of dressing and makeup among the Igbos at the 
  period the book was set. Traditionally, the Igbos (Ibos), especially Igbo women, 
  believed in and valued decorating their bodies for a variety of reasons including 
  aesthetics. There is a saying in Igbo, "One's body is his/her temple." Body 
  decorations for women included various styles of hairdos and also involved painting 
  the body with temporary traditional cosmetic makeup, using <I>nzu</I> (white 
  chalk), <I>uri</I> or <I>uli</I> (black dye used by women to draw ornamental 
  patterns on each other's body), <I>edo</I> (yellow dye), and <I>ufie</I> or 
  <I>uhie</I> (carmine). Later, during this period, women started wearing loose 
  natural black eye powder (<I>tanjele</I>) on the eyelids. In preparation for 
  the Feast of the New Yam, Achebe noted on pages 37-38 of <I>Things Fall Apart:</I></font></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Okonkwo's 
  wives ... set about painting themselves with cam wood and drawing beautiful 
  black patterns on their stomachs and on their backs. The children were also 
  decorated, especially their hair, which was shaved in beautiful patterns.<BR>
  </font></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Page 71:</font></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">She (i.e. 
  Akueke) wore a coiffure which was done up into a crest in the middle of the 
  head. Cam wood was rubbed lightly into her skin, and all over her body were 
  black patterns drawn with <I>uli.</I></font></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Page 115:</font></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The bride's 
  attendant maidens ... "were putting the last delicate touches of razor to her 
  (i.e. Akueke's) hair and cam wood on her smooth skin."</font></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><I>Uli </I>and 
  <I>Ufie</I> are not used for decorative purposes only. Women rub <I>ufie</I> 
  on their bodies for medicinal reasons. It refreshes and rejuvenates the body. 
  Since <I>ufie </I>stains clothes, women often designate a cloth or one of their 
  wrappers as"akwa ufie" (akwa means cloth).<BR>
  <BR>
  <I>Uli</I> is circled around the eyes of a person suffering from measles or 
  chicken pox to prevent the spots from going into the eyes. It is also rubbed 
  on the joints of someone suffering from joint pains, known in Igbo as <I>mgbuji,</I> 
  to relieve pains.<BR>
  <BR>
  High or chief priests also decorated their bodies with cosmetic makeup during 
  rituals. At Ogbuefi Ezeudu's funeral, men "wore smoked raffia skirts" and painted 
  their bodies with chalk and charcoal (p. 121, <I>Things Fall Apart)</I>). Depending 
  on the clan or village, more permanent scarification marks (<I>igbu ichi</I>) 
  may be carved on the faces of titled men (<I>ozo</I>) and on the faces and stomachs 
  of titled women.</font></P>

  and so on</B><BR>
  <BR>
  At this point in history, the only purpose of clothing in Igboland was to cover 
  private parts. Children are believed to have nothing to hide and are usually 
  naked. A child may wear a string of beads around the waist for medicinal purposes 
  or reasons. Igbo women always carried babies on their backs with a strip of 
  clothing. A tradition that has continued until today.<BR>
  <BR>
  In most cases, women did not have to cover the breast area. As Achebe noted 
  on page 71 of <I>Things Fall Apart:</I></font></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">She (i.e. 
  Akueke) wore a black necklace which hung down in three coils just above her 
  full, succulent breasts... and on her waist, four or five rows of jigida, or 
  waist beads.</font></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Page 103:</font></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">She (i.e. 
  Ekwefi) began to run, holding her breats with her hands to stop them flapping 
  noisily against her body.</font></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Both men and women 
  wore native wrappers (<I>akwa omuma</I> or <I>akwa owuwa</I>). On page 10 of 
  <I>Things Fall Apart, </I>Achebe wrote:</font></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He (i.e. 
  Ogbuefi Ezeugo) then adjusted his cloth, which was passed under his right arm-pit 
  and tied above his shoulder.</font></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Page 58:</font></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">... the 
  men (i.e. the elders) ... were all fully dressed ... They passed their cloths 
  under the right arm-pit ...</font></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Additionally, 
  men wore loin clothes in place of wrappers to cover their private parts. The 
  loin clothes would go under the crotch and were tied together with a rope around 
  the waist. This type of clothing appropriately provided much needed freedom 
  of movement due to the nature of the jobs (farming, hunting, and palm wine tapping) 
  and social activities (wrestling , etc.). Another "style" of loin cloth was 
  the underwear described by Achebe on p.82:</font></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Okagbue 
  "was in his underwear, a long and thin strip of cloth wound round the waist 
  like a belt and then passed between the legs to be fastened to the belt behind."</font></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><I>Ozo</I> men 
  wore special treads on their ankles. Achebe mentioned several times in <I>Things 
  Fall Apart,</I> that men carried goatskin bags in which they kept essential 
  items such as their drinking horns--animals' horns (<I>opi</I>) or a special 
  gourd shaped like a cup for drinking palm wine, as well as snuff-bottle and 
  its spoon. In <I>Things Fall Apart,</I> Okonkwo drank palm-wine from his first 
  human head (his first war victim) at great occasions such as the funeral of 
  a village celebrity.<BR>
  <br>
  Men also carried with them to ceremonies, animal skins, especially goatskins 
  with which to sit on the floor, or carved wooden stools usally brought o the 
  ceremony for them by one of their sons. Hunters who have slain a hard-to-kill 
  animal, such as a lion, carried the dried skin of the animal to ceremonies to 
  serve as a mat for sitting.<BR>
  <BR>
  Women wrapped thick locally made textile fabrics (<I>ekwerike</I>) around their 
  waist areas or dressed in strung beads known as <I>jigida</I> in place of <I>ekwerike,</I> 
  and <I>painted or rubbed uli</I> and<I>ufie</I> on their bodies. Wealthy women 
  wore carved elephant tusks, the <I>odu,</I> on their arms and/or legs to ceremonies 
  following their initiations into the odu women's society.<BR>
  <BR>
  Eventually, Western influence began when Africa was colonized. Missionaries 
  came to Igbo land and other parts of Africa. Christianity was introduced. Males 
  began to wear jumpers, shorts, trousers, and shirts. Females wore skirts, wrappers, 
  and blouses. Clothing was redesigned to cover the entire body, not just private 
  parts. Western manufactured makeup was prized over the traditional natural counterparts. 
  Several villagers still maintain the old traditional beliefs and values to this 
  day. Recently, Westerners have begun to value and to prefer traditional African 
  products with natural ingredients, such as the black soap.</font></P>
