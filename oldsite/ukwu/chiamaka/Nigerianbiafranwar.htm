                <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During 

                one of my trips to Chicago earlier this year, I watched a HBO 

                documentary about children at war. I switched to a different channel 

                after listening to a little Middle Eastern boy describe how his 

                father had died in his arms when their mosque was bombed and several 

                people were massacred. I did not switch channels because what 

                I saw was terrifying to me. On the contrary, these scenes were 

                quite familiar, more like a deja vu.</font></p>

              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 

                horrific experiences of children in war areas have become news 

                topics on television. Recently at home, my children and I watched 

                a program on the television about children in war torn areas of 

                Bosnia, Rwanda, and so on. There is some relief knowing that people 

                are now beginning to address the realities of the grim and gruesome 

                violence of war as it relates to people who have absolutely no 

                reason to be included in it at all in the first place, i.e. children. 

                My kids were truly dumbfounded to see several wounded children 

                and the ones that lost one or both parents. I had to convince 

                them that these stories are true and real.</font></p>

              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 

                was a child during the Nigerian-Biafran Civil War, May 30, 1967 

                to January 15, 1970. This was a war between Northern (Nigeria) 

                and Eastern (Biafra) Nigeria. There is nothing "civil" about a 

                war, any war. By the end of this particular war, several hundred 

                thousand of people have died and/or lost their valuable belongings. 

                Thousands of civilians, especially children, lost their lives 

                to malnutrition or suffered kwashiokor, a vitamin defficiency 

                disease. I am one of the lucky few who survived. As a child, I 

                never understood what caused this war. As an adult I have come 

                to accept the saying that, "when men get frustrated, they go to 

                war; when women get frustrated they go shopping."</font></p>

              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 

                remember us "running" from one village, city or town to another, 

                dodging bullets and bombshells, or hiding in underground bunkers 

                during enemy attacks . A bunker was a camouflaged underground 

                shelter and people sought refuge in bunkers or under trees during 

                "air raids," i.e. the bombing or firing of gunshots from airplanes. 

                Bunkers were well constructed and some were extensively decorated 

                and stocked with food and water since they were "second homes." 

                Each compound had at least one bunker. I wonder if they still 

                exist.</font></p>

              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 

                Igbos coined a name for the evacuation or "running" process, "oso 

                ndu agwu ike." Translated literally, this phrase means, "one never 

                gets tired of running for one's life or one never gets tired of 

                seeking shelter for one's life." It may also mean, there's no 

                rest in life, as life is full of ongoing struggles. My mother, 

                my older and younger sisters, and I moved from one village to 

                another. My maternal grandmother stayed with us from time to time 

                or with my uncle, my mother's older brother. We only took what 

                we could grab and carry (often the clothing on our back) since 

                we did not know how far we would be trekking on foot. Often, if 

                or when things calmed down, the grown-ups would go back and try 

                to retrieve some or the rest of the belongings. Otherwise, the 

                items were lost.</font></p>

              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 

                my case, I always grabbed my mother's gold jewelry box and a bag 

                of crayfish. I never quite understood the correlation between 

                the box of gold and the bag of crayfish. My mother, realizing 

                that these were the two items that I absolutely must leave with, 

                made sure that they were always kept close to wherever I slept. 

                I remember one such attack one night while I was asleep. My sister 

                grabbed my hands and started walking. We must have walked for 

                miles when I woke up. I realized also that I was carrying my mother's 

                jewelry box and a bag of crayfish in my hands!</font></p>

              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One 

                of my playmates died during one of the evacuations. She had just 

                undergone surgery to have her appendicitis removed. The town was 

                attacked later that evening. She died in her parents' arms as 

                they were fleeing to "safety."</font></p>

              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Schools 

                and churches were instantly turned into refugee camps for those 

                who did not know any other family members in the "new" village. 

                Most of the attacks happened at night when civilians were asleep. 

                People died in the rampage as they tried to evacuate in a rush. 

                Others "lost" or were "cut off" from their<br>

                chat her husband, a soldier, thinking that she had been killed 

                in the war, had married another woman. She was truly heartbroken.</font></p>

              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some 

                men joined the army voluntarily. Others were captured and forced 

                to sign up to defend their country. My oldest brother, cousins, 

                and uncles all went to war. Men usually would not tell anyone 

                where they were going as they left home to avoid any discouragement. 

                They would send letters to their families telling them that they 

                were in the Army and needed our support and prayers. They believed 

                that if they died, at least it would be an honorable death in 

                the line of duty. Many young men lost parts of their bodies-limbs, 

                ear(s), eye(s)-hearing, or worse, their lives during this war. 

                It became a normal sight to see one-legged,<br>

                -eyed, -armed, and -eared men everywhere since wounded soldiers 

                were sent home from the battlefield. Many soldiers lost their 

                lives during the war. Some families lost their only child. There 

                are still many disabled war veterans at the rehabilitation center 

                at Oji River in Eastern Nigeria. Their condition is deplorable 

                to say the least. Many wounded veterans and civilians have ended 

                up on the street as beggars.</font></p>

              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 

                were one of the few fortunate families. My brother was wounded 

                but he survived the war. He came home from time to time to visit 

                us. We always looked forward to seeing him. He had a lot of fascinating 

                stories to share with us. I still cannot figure out how he traced 

                us since we moved from one place to another in search of a safe 

                place to stay. When the time came for him to leave, we always 

                prayed to God to let us see him again.</font></p>

              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My 

                oldest sister worked for Caritas, the international charity organization, 

                which supplied most of the food for civilians during the war. 

                My mother always introduced her as her daughter-in-law, my brother's 

                wife. This way she was able to keep the "women-hungry" soldiers 

                away. At one point, she stuffed a pillow in her stomach to look 

                pregnant. My other brother was "left behind" because he went to 

                visit his father (my stepfather) at the time we left Enugu. We 

                did not see him until the war ended.</font></p>

              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My 

                father was working in Lagos during the war. He was "cut off" from 

                us. He did not see us nor hear from us (nor we him) until the 

                end of the war. Then he was very nervous and scared to face the 

                reality that we might be dead. His family decided to send my uncle, 

                his nephew, who grew up in Enugu and could speak a few words of 

                Igbo, to try to locate us. Upon receiving the good news about 

                our survival, my father jumped on the next flight to Enugu. He 

                had spent all those years worrying about us. The only pictures 

                that he and whole world saw of Biafran children were of those 

                dying from hunger or from the deadly malnutrition disease, kwashiokor. 

                Fortunately, neither one of us died or even came close to suffering 

                from kwashiokor or any other vitamin-deficient disease. My mom 

                believed in the powers of vegetables and fed us tons of them: 

                bitter leaf, "green" "ugu" "ora" or "oha" and whatever else was 

                available. They worked miracles for us.</font></p>

              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It 

                is ironic that as sad as this story is, we also encountered a 

                number of memorable experiences. We met a lot of wonderful people 

                who opened-up their homes to us, the refugees. We learned other 

                people's cultures too. The Igbos have different cultures. One 

                of the most of most hospitable and eye-popping places we stayed 

                in was in a town in the Idemili local area. We stayed with a widow 

                and her children. The woman's husband died immediately after the 

                birth of their youngest child, a daughter. The widow betrothed 

                this daughter at birth to a wealthy man. Wealth in the old days 

                in some parts of the world is measured by the number of wives, 

                farms, livestock (sheep, goats, cows, etc.) a man has. This man 

                was definitely wealthy on these terms. When the widow's daughter 

                became a teenager, her husband's family came to take their bride 

                home. We were shocked when we realized that the man we had mistaken 

                as her groom's grandfather was actually the groom. She went home 

                with them, an unhappy bride. She would run back home from time 

                to time but was sent back to her husband by her mother.</font></p>

              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 

                saw a python for the first time in my life in this village. Upon 

                our arrival, the villagers informed my mother of their belief: 

                it is an abomination to kill a python. If one kills a python, 

                he or she is expected to give the python a "befitting" burial, 

                the same burial rites one would give to a human being. The Idemili 

                River is located in this area. It is believed that this river 

                is inhabited by very forceful and powerful supernatural beings, 

                including the mermaid. Since the pythons live near the river, 

                they belong to the mermaid and the river. Harming them in any 

                way, even accidentally, would bring harm to not only the person 

                who harmed them but also to the person's family and maybe the 

                entire village or town. I have never personally witnessed a python's 

                burial.</font></p>

              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One 

                of my aunts who was partially blind told us how a python had crawled 

                into her room and curled-up on the floor mat right next to her 

                bed. She started wiping her feet on her "mat" as she always did 

                before getting into her bed at night. This woman was afraid of 

                ants and nearly suffered a heart attack when she realized that 

                her "mat" can now breathe! Talk about a rude awakening.</font></p>

              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My 

                personal encounter with the python happened when my baby sister 

                and I were playing outdoors. Suddenly, we noticed a colorful "scarf" 

                in the wall. We thought that someone had lost her scarf. We wanted 

                to retrieve it from the wall and return it to the owner. Fortunately 

                for us, there was a big garden separating us from the wall. Afraid 

                to trample on the crops, we decided to go back to the house and 

                bring an adult to help us. We told the homeowner what we had seen. 

                He knew instantly that we had seen a python but kept this to himself 

                so as not to scare us. He and a few others accompanied us to "retrieve 

                the scarf." By the time we got close to the wall, we witnessed 

                the "longest moving scarf on earth" and it is not wearable! The 

                python had uncurled itself. It was us and a huge python, up close 

                and personal! The homeowner simply put a long stick to it and 

                it curled around it. He then released it into the bushes. I made 

                up my mind right there and then that if anyone loses anything 

                colorful and I happen to find it first, I will never pick it up.</font></p>

                of the steep, rugged hills or terrain leading to the water. There 

                are some parts of the river that we were banned from approaching 

                due to the "unnatural forces" or superstitious beliefs associated 

                with such areas. Many people have drowned or mysteriously disappeared 

                there. In the areas of the river that we could go near, the swimming 

                area was sectioned off from the area people would wash clothes. 

                Drinking water was usually collected from the "mouth" of the river 

                or the part of the river from where it flowed downward.</font></p>

              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Each 

                person carried with him or her a container that s(he) knew s(he) 

                could lift once it was filled with water. I was a tomboy and at 

                the "I can do it stage" during this time. I started initially 

                with a bigger container. By the time I reached home, I had a few 

                cups left in the container or one of the other adults would be 

                lugging my container as well as his/hers. My mother gave me small 

                a plastic kettle. My swimming/water fetching companions preferred 

                that I stayed home. On occasion, they would try to sneak off to 

                the river but I was very vigilant.</font></p>

              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There 

                was nothing like teenagers tagging along. It's always a new experience. 

                Take my cousins for example, they are very "creative" young men. 

                They used to have a "shitting competition" (yes, number 2). Some 

                bush areas close to the river and that are not "marked" are usually 

                used as toilets. When an area is "marked" or there is a warning, 

                the display of red rag, etc., we would stay out of it. Farms are 

                usually "marked" and anyone violating the signs may be severely 

                punished. We could "go" anywhere in the unmarked areas as long 

                as we found a clean spot. My cousins went into the bush, one at 

                a time. I wondered why they all simply could not go in at the 

                same time since there was enough space for everyone. That was 

                when they told me that they were having this competition whereby 

                each one "goes" on top of each other's #2. They were trying to 

                "build" some sort of a "mound" bigger than the one(s) they had 

                "built" the previous time(s)! In a time of war? You have just 

                witnessed the minds of "would-be" men who would have gone to war 

                to defend us if the war had not come to an end when it did!</font></p>

              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 

                all knew that it was risky and dangerous to leave home for any 

                reason, even to fetch water. We always worried because we knew 

                that air raids or evacuations may happen at any time. During one 

                of the air raids, the village's market was bombed by the enemies 

                on one of <a href="http://lib.lbcc.cc.ca.us/igbonames.htm"> the 

                Igbo market days</a>. Countless number of civilians were wounded 

                or killed.</font></p>

              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There 

                was a lot of jubilation when we heard the news that the war had 

                ended. I consider war one of those unfortunate experiences one 

                has to live through and survive to appreciate little things around 

                us. Although the Biafrans had lost, we were all tired and desperate 

                to go back home. We went back to Enugu. Several houses were destroyed. 

                The houses that were not destroyed were looted. Understandably, 

                many people suffered heart attacks or high blood pressure upon 

                seeing their homes. Several Igbos lived, worked or conducted businesses 

                in other parts of the country. Those who owned properties in notably 

                Port Harcourt and the northern states, lost their undamaged properties 

                and belongings when they were forced to return home to Eastern 

                Nigeria. Their properties were declared "abandoned properties" 

                by the governments of such states. Gradually, those who survived 

                have reclaimed, rebuilt or replaced their properties. My grandfather 

                used to say that "everything bought/purchased with money can be 

                replaced. Lost lives are irreplaceable."</font></p>

              
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My 
              mother's two houses were undamaged. We found out our belongings 
              were looted and that a bizarre thing happened to my mother's clothes. 
              I believe we must have been robbed by a dummy or dummies. The thieves 
              stole parts of her complete sets of clothing: her wrapper but not 
              her blouse, or vice versa which is like stealing the jacket of a 
              suit but not the skirt and vice versa. We never figured this out. 
              My mother had the most elegant and exquisite collection of African 
              clothes you can find in one place. One of the looters was a young 
              man who lived (and still does) across the street from us. He became 
              a "born again" Christian and later returned the items he had taken 
              from our house to my mother just before she died in 1978.</font></p>

              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 

                am happy that I finally had the courage to tell my children that 

                l lived through a war as a child. We talk about the war sometimes 

                when fathers in his home town with proper ceremonies . A woman 

                who gave birth to a son is often buried in her husband's village. 

                It is for this reason that many families went back to the villages 

                that they had stayed in to exhume the bodies of those whom they 

                had lost and had buried there during the war--their sons, husbands, 

                fathers, wives, mothers, and so on. The deceased were brought 

                back home, given befitting burial ceremony or ceremonies and re-buried. 

                These families are considered lucky. They had their beloved one's 

                body or bodies to bury.</font></p>

              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Those 

                families whose sons, husbands, fathers, etc. died at war fronts 

                have no corpse to bury. Many of these MIAs were later publicly 

                declared dead by their families. This way, proper burial ceremonies 

                were held for them. This ceremony was very crucial, especially 

                for those who were married. Their wives or husbands mourned them 

                and possibly remarried. You may click <a href="IgbosSuicide.htm">here</a>

            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Though 
              not verbatim, I still remember a few words from the poem, <i>The 
              Casualties</i> (J. P. Clark) in which he wrote that "the casualties 
              of war are not only those who went to war, but also those they left 
              behind." There is a verse in an African poem which I read recently 
              that summarizes the aftermath of war:</font></p>

            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Suffice 
              it to say that we must also take the time to document our memories 
              and stories as each one is unique ... for the sake of our children 
              and our history. I have decided to write down what I still remember 
              for my children and for others who are interested. The more I have 
              tried to forget, the more I remembered. War is terrible. Although 
              one side ends up winning a war, no one truly wins.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 

                have read a lot of books about the Nigeria-Biafran Civil War. 

                They all discussed the causes and consequences of this war. So 

                far, I have read only one book that described the daily experience 

                of civilians during this war. This book is a fiction, written 

                in the Igbo language, is titled <i>Isi Akwu Dara Na Ala Emetu 

                Na Aja</i> (irreparable damage or damaged beyond repair). Translated 

                literally, the English equivalent of the title is: a broken vase/bottle 

                can never be fixed. Although this is a work of fiction, the subject 

                matter seemed truly real. The book focussed on the dilemma of 

                a very rich man who suddenly lost all his wealth and became poor 

                when he and his family were evacuated from the city due to the 

                war. His wife turned to prostitution and blatantly flaunted her 

                affairs with the Biafran army boyfriends at her husband. If the 

                husband refuted her actions, her boyfriends would deal with him 

                severely. When the war came to an end, the Biafran army became 

                defunct and she lost all her "wealthy" boyfriends. Fortunately 

                for the husband, none of his property and wealth were destroyed 

                during the war. When the wife begged for his forgiveness, he refused, 

                claiming that when he was rich, he took care of his family. When 

                the shoe was on the other foot, the opposite was the case. Hence, 

                the title of the book.</font></p>

              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 

                book also described the experiences of one family, who during 

                an evacuation, took their food with them. When they got to the 

                bank of a river, they decided to rest and eat before continuing 

                with their journey. There were other (very) hungry people around 

                them. The family had to resolve some very difficult issues:</font></p>

              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(a) 

                should they wash their hands before eating their food or should 

                they eat their food with their dirty hands because if they leave 

                to wash their hands, others will take their food.<br>

                <br>

                (b) If they decide to go and wash their hands one at a time, their 

                hands, with which they will eat the food will dry up before the 

                other people returned from the river.<br>

                <br>
              The issue of trust was also addressed here. Should the person(s) 
              left with the food be trusted to wait patiently for others to go 
              and wash their hands?</font></p>
