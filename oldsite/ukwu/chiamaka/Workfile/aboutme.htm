<P>On a personal note, I am originally from <A HREF="nigeria.htm">Nigeria</A>
in West Africa. My mother is from <A HREF="http://www.onitshaado.com">Onitsha</A>,
an <A HREF="igbo.htm">Igbo</A> tribe in Eastern Nigeria. My father is
from Ijebu, a <A HREF="yoruba.htm">Yoruba</A> tribe in <A HREF="http://www.nigerianembassy.org/government/states/ogun.shmtl">Ogun
State</A>, Western Nigeria. I was born in the city of Enugu in
<A HREF="http://lib.lbcc.cc.ca.us/enugustate.htm" http>Enugu
State</A>, which is located in Eastern Nigeria. I was a child during
the Nigerian-Biafran Civil War and I have provided a brief account of
what I remember about this war at: <A HREF="http://lib.lbcc.cc.ca.us/NigerianBiafranwar.htm">http://lib.lbcc.cc.ca.us/NigerianBiafranwar.htm</A>.<BR>

<BR>
Librarianship is more challenging and demanding in this current
technology-oriented world. It is fallacy to believe that all a
librarian does is to assist people at the reference desk and/or warn
library patrons not to make noise or not to disturb others.<BR>
<BR>
On the contrary, librarians are inundated with assignments and
various complicated and time consuming tasks. The duties of a
librarian varies depending on our place of employment. We may attain
faculty status; be required to publish; participate on both on- and
off-campus committees; attend, coordinate, and present workshops and
conferences; be active members of professional associations and
organizations.<BR>
<BR>
I am a full time tenured faculty librarian at the <A HREF="http://lib.lbcc.cc.ca.us/index.html">Long
Beach City College Library</A>, my principal responsibility is
cataloging. I have provided a comprehensive essay on what is involved
in cataloging at <A HREF="Cataloging.htm">http://lib.lbcc.cc.ca.us/Cataloging.htm</A>.
Prior to this assignment, I worked at the <A HREF="http://lib.lmu.edu">Loyola
Marymount University Library</A> library in Los Angeles.<BR>
<BR>
I also serve at the <A HREF="http://lib.lbcc.cc.ca.us/libreference.html">
reference desk</A> where I assist library patrons with a variety of
questions ranging from directional to complicated questions to
teaching and instantly providing workshops to groups with similar
questions.<BR>
<BR>
Additionally, I provide orientations and bibliographic instructions
to library patrons to introduce them to resources available to them.
I teach patrons how construct search strategies to effectively
conduct their research and find the information that they are
seeking.<BR>
<BR>
I participate in collection development by suggesting and selecting
titles to be added to the library's collection. This assignment
involves reviewing appropriate sources to select pertinent titles. As
a librarian, we "graduate" from school only in theory. We never stop
reading, writing, and researching. The only difference is that as a
professional, we get paid to do these.<BR>
<BR>
My colleagues and I have also compiled several handouts for your use.

I attend professional meetings, workshops, and conferences. I also
serve as a member of number committees campus-wide including self
study accreditation committee, and Faculty Professional Development
Committee, and several hiring committees both as a voting member and
as the LBCC Academic Senate Affirmative Action Representative. I have
also served as a reviewer/evaluator for both full and part-time
tenured and non-tenured faculty. I am a member of the LBCC Academic
Senate Faculty Resource Center subcommittee. I represent the LBCC
library faculty on the LBCC CCA Representative Council. I have
coordinated and presented several workshops to introduce the LBCC
faculty to library resources on Flex Days. I am the chairperson of
the LBCC non-print resources subcommittee. I am also the chairperson
of <I>Voyager</I> Migration Task Force. <I>Voyager</I> is the new
online database that will be replacing our current online database.
Both committees involve extensively coordinating related activities
in different departments so as to maintain a coherent workflow from
cataloging and processing an item to its circulation. These duties
also involve researching and compiling policies and procedures.<BR>
